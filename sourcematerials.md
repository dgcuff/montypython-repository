## _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_
The screenplay for _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ was not included in/among the sketches, even though it had some bits of the movie. I don't remember where I picked it up, but the [introduction](/holygrail/introduction) document speaks to the nature of the screenplay and how it may vary from the theatrical release.
