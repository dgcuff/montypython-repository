# Hello and Welcome!
After a years-long hiatus, following several host and technology changes, this site will be the _new_ home for Matt's Monty Python Repository.

## [About the Repository](#about-the-repository)
Sometime ca. 1996, I discovered a collection of transcribed Monty Python material on a random newsgroup. Most of the material was transcribed by college students around the world in the mid-1980's.

In 1997, I started stitching together these materials into this repository, starting with the transcript of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. In fits and starts, I did this with the source materials until about 2005, at which point the site took a bit of a long sleep, being ported between technologies but not receiving any real love, care, or feeding.

In 2019, my intent was to port the old content into Drupal, but the ambition never really materialized. And in late 2021, I settled on Github pages as the best and most sustainable long-term host for this niche content.
