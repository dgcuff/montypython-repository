_A man walks into an office._
 
**Man**: Good morning, I'd like to have an argument, please.

**Receptionist**: Certainly, sir. Have you been here before?

**Man**: No, this is my first time.

**Receptionist**: I see, well we'll see who's free at the moment. Mr. Bakely's free, but he's a little bit concilliatory. No. Try Mr. Barnhart, room 12.

**Man**: Thank you.
 
_He enters room 12._
 
**Angry man**: WHADDAYOU WANT?

**Man**: Well, Well, I was told outside that...

**Angry man**: DON'T GIVE ME THAT, YOU SNOTTY-FACED HEAP OF PARROT DROPPINGS!

**Man**: What?

**A**: SHUT YOUR FESTERING GOB, YOU TIT! YOUR TYPE MAKES ME PUKE! YOU VACUOUS STUFFY-NOSED MALODOROUS PERVERT!!!

**M**: Yes, but I came here for an argument!!

**A**: OH! Oh! I'm sorry! This is abuse!

**M**: Oh! Oh I see!

**A**: Aha! No, you want room 12A, next door.

**M**: Oh...Sorry...

**A**: Not at all!

**A**: _(under his breath)_ stupid git.
 
_The man goes into room 12A. Another man is sitting behind a desk._
 
**Man**: Is this the right room for an argument?

**Other Man**: _(pause)_ I've told you once.

**Man**: No you haven't!

**Other Man**: Yes I have.

**M**: When?

**O**: Just now.

**M**: No you didn't!

**O**: Yes I did!

**M**: You didn't!

**O**: I did!

**M**: You didn't!

**O**: I'm telling you, I did!

**M**: You didn't!

**O**: _(breaking into the developing argument)_ Oh I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?

**M**: Ah! _(taking out his wallet and paying)_ Just the five minutes.

**O**: Just the five minutes. Thank you. Anyway, I did.

**M**: You most certainly did not!

**O**: Now let's get one thing perfectly clear: I most definitely told you!

**M**: Oh no you didn't!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

_progressively faster exchange_

**M**: Oh no you didn't!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: Oh no you didn't!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: Oh no you didn't!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: Oh no you didn't!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: Oh no you didn't!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: No you DIDN'T!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: No you DIDN'T!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: No you DIDN'T!

**O**: Oh yes I did!

**M**: Oh look, this isn't an argument!
 
_(pause)_
 
**O**: Yes it is!

**M**: No it isn't!
 
_(pause)_
 
**M**: It's just contradiction!

**O**: No it isn't!

**M**: It IS!

**O**: It is NOT!

**M**: You just contradicted me!

**O**: No I didn't!

**M**: You DID!

**O**: No no no!

**M**: You did just then!

**O**: Nonsense!

**M**: _(exasperated)_ Oh, this is futile!!
 
_(pause)_
 
**O**: No it isn't!

**M**: Yes it is! _(pause)_ I came here for a good argument!

**O**: AH, no you didn't, you came here for an *argument*!

**M**: An argument isn't just contradiction.

**O**: Well! it CAN be!

**M**: No it can't! An argument is a connected series of statement intended to establish a proposition.

**O**: No it isn't!

**M**: Yes it is! 'tisn't just contradiction.

**O**: Look, if I *argue* with you, I must take up a contrary position!

**M**: Yes but it isn't just saying "no it isn't".

**O**: Yes it is!

**M**: No it isn't!

**O**: Yes it is!

**M**: No it isn't!

**O**: Yes it is!

**M**: No it ISN'T! Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.

**O**: It is NOT!

**M**: It is!

**O**: Not at all!

**M**: It is!
 
_>DING!< The Arguer hits a bell on his desk and stops._
 
**O**: Thank you, that's it.

**M**: _(stunned)_ What?
 
**O**: That's it. Good morning.

**M**: But I was just getting interested!

**O**: I'm sorry, the five minutes is up.

**M**: That was never five minutes!!

**O**: I'm afraid it was.

**M**: _(leading on)_ No it wasn't.....
 
_(pause)_

**O**: _(dirty look)_ I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to argue any more.

**M**: WHAT??

**O**: If you want me to go on arguing, you'll have to pay for another five minutes.

**M**: But that was never five minutes just now!

_(pause... the Other Man raises his eyebrows)_

**M**: Oh Come on! Oh this is... This is ridiculous!

**O**: I told you... I told you, I'm not allowed to argue unless you PAY!

**M**: Oh all right. _(takes out his wallet and pays again.)_ There you are.

**O**: Thank you.

**M**: _(clears throat)_ Well...

**O**: Well WHAT?

**M**: That was never five minutes just now.

**O**: I told you, I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid!

**M**: Well I just paid!

**O**: No you didn't!

**M**: I DID!!!

**O**: YOU didn't!

**M**: I DID!!!

**O**: YOU didn't!

**M**: I DID!!!

**O**: YOU didn't!

**M**: I DID!!!

**O**: YOU didn't!

**M**: _(unable to talk straight he's so mad)_ I don't want to argue about it!

**O**: Well I'm very sorry but you didn't pay!

**M**: Ah HAH!! Well if I didn't pay, why are you arguing??? Ah HAAAAAAHHH! Gotcha!
 
**O**: _(pause)_ No you haven't!

**M**: Yes I have! If you're arguing, I must have paid.

**O**: Not necessarily. I *could* be arguing in my spare time.
