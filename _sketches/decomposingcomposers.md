Beethoven's gone, but his music lives on,\
And Mozart don't go shopping no more.\
You'll never meet Lizst or Brahms again,\
And Elgar doesn't answer the door.\
 
Schubert and Chopin used to chuckle and laugh,\
Whilst composing a long symphony.\
But one hundred and fifty years later,\
There's very little of them left to see.\
 
The decomposing composers,\
There's not much anyone can do.\
You can still hear Beethoven,\
But Beethoven cannot hear you.\
 
Handel and Haydn and Rachmaninoff\
Enjoyed a nice drink with their meal.\
But nowadays no one will serve them,\
And their gravy is left to congeal.\
 
Verdi and Wagner delighted the crowds\
With their highly original sounds.\
The pianos they play are still working,\
But they're both six feet underground.\
 
The decomposing composers,\
There's less of them every year.\
You can say what you like to\
But there's not much of them left to hear.\
