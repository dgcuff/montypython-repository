**Customer**: _(entering the bookshop)_ Good morning.

**Proprietor _(John Cleese)_**: Good morning, sir. Can I help you?

**C**: Er, yes. Do you have a copy of "Thirty Days in the Samarkind Desert with the Duchess of Kent" by A. E. J. Eliott, O.B.E.?

**P**: Ah, well, I don't know the book, sir....

**C**: Er, never mind, never mind. How about "A Hundred and One Ways to Start a Fight"?

**P**: ...By?

**C**: An Irish gentleman whose name eludes me for the moment.

**P**: Ah, no, well we haven't got it in stock, sir....

**C**: Oh, well, not to worry, not to worry. Can you help me with "David Coperfield"?

**P**: Ah, yes, Dickens.

**C**: No....

**P**: _(pause)_ I beg your pardon?

**C**: No, Edmund Wells.

**P**: I... *think* you'll find Charles Dickens wrote "David Copperfield", sir....

**C**: No, no, Dickens wrote "David Copperfield" with *two* Ps. This is "David Coperfield" with *one* P by Edmund Wells.

**P**: "David Coperfield" with one P?

**C**: Yes, I should have said.

**P**: Yes, well in that case we don't have it.

**C**: _(peering over counter)_ Funny, you've got a lot of books here....

**P**: _(slightly perturbed)_ Yes, we do, but we don't have "David Coperfield" with one P by Edmund Wells.

**C**: Pity, it's more thorough than the Dickens.

**P**: More THOROUGH?!?

**C**: Yes...I wonder if it might be worth a look through all your "David Copperfield"s...

**P**: No, sir, all our "David Copperfield"s have two P's.

**C**: Are you quite sure?

**P**: Quite.

**C**: Not worth just looking?

**P**: Definitely not.

**C**: Oh...how 'bout "Grate Expectations"?

**P**: Yes, well we have that....

**C**: That's "G-R-A-T-E Expectations," also by Edmund Wells.

**P**: _(pause)_ Yes, well in that case we don't have it. We don't have anything by Edmund Wells, actually: he's not very popular.

**C**: Not "Knickerless Knickleby"? That's K-N-I-C-K-E-R-L-E-S-S.

**P**: _(taciturn)_ No.

**C**: "Khristmas Karol" with a K?

**P**: _(really quite perturbed)_ No....

**C**: Er, how about "A Sale of Two Titties"?

**P**: DEFINITELY NOT.

**C**: _(moving towards door)_ Sorry to trouble you....

**P**: Not at all....

**C**: Good morning.

**P**: Good morning.

**C**: _(turning around)_ Oh!

**P**: _(deep breath)_ Yesss?

**C**: I wonder if you might have a copy of "Rarnaby Budge"?

**P**: No, as I say, we're right out of Edmund Wells!

**C**: No, not Edmund Wells - Charles Dikkens.

**P**: _(pause - eagerly)_ Charles Dickens??

**C**: Yes.

**P**: _(excitedly)_ You mean "Barnaby Rudge"!

**C**: No, "Rarnaby Budge" by Charles Dikkens. That's Dikkens with two Ks, the well-known Dutch author.

**P**: _(slight pause)_ No, well we don't have "Rarnaby Budge" by Charles Dikkens with two Ks, the well-known Dutch author, and perhaps to save time I should add that we don't have "Karnaby Fudge" by Darles Chickens, or "Farmer of Sludge" by Marles Pickens, or even "Stickwick Stapers" by Farles Wickens with four M's and a silent Q!!!!! Why don't you try W. H. Smith's?

**C**: Ah did, They sent me here.

**P**: DID they.


**C**: Oh, I wonder...

**P**: Oh, do go on, please.

**C**: Yes...I wonder if you might have "The Amazing Adventures of Captain Gladys Stoutpamphlet and her Intrepid Spaniel Stig Amongst the Giant Pygmies of Beckles"...volume eight.

**P**: _(after a pause for recovery)_ No, we don't have that...funny, we've got a lot of books here...well, I musn't keep you standing here...thank you,--

**C**: Oh, well do, do you have--

**P**: _(progressively louder arguments)_ No, we haven't. No, we haven't.

**C**: B-b-b-but--

**P**: Sorry, no, it's one o'clock now, we're closing for lunch--

**C**: Ah, I--I saw it--

**P**: I'm sorry--

**C**: I saw it over there! I saw it...

**P**: What? What? WHAT?!?

**C**: I saw it over there: "Olsen's Standard Book of British Birds".

**P**: _(pause; trying to stay calm)_ "Olsen's Standard Book of British Birds"?

**C**: Yes...

**P**: O-L-S-E-N?

**C**: Yes....

**P**: B-I-R-D-S??

**C**: Yes.....

**P**: _(beat)_ Yes, well, we do have that, as a matter of fact....

**C**: The expurgated version....

**P**: _(pause; politely)_ I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that...?

**C**: The expurgated version.

**P**: _(exploding)_ The EXPURGATED version of "Olsen's Standard Book of British Birds"?!?!?!?!?

**C**: _(desperately)_ The one without the gannet!

**P**: The one without the gannet-!!! They've ALL got the gannet!! It's a Standard British Bird, the gannet, it's in all the books!!!

**C**: _(insistent)_ Well, I don't like them...they wet their nests.

**P**: _(furious)_ All right! I'll remove it!! _(rrrip!)_ Any other birds you don't like?!

**C**: I don't like the robin...

**P**: _(screaming)_ The robin! Right! The robin! _(rrrip!)_ There you are, any others you don't like, any others?

**C**: The nuthatch?

**P**: Right! _(flipping through the book)_ The nuthatch, the nuthatch, the nuthatch, 'ere we are! _(rrriiip!)_ There you are! NO gannets, NO robins, NO nuthatches, THERE's your book!

**C**: _(indignant)_ I can't buy that! It's torn!

**P**: _(incoherent noise)_

**C**: Ah, I wonder if you have--

**P**: God, ask me anything!! We got lots of books here, you know, it's a bookshop!!

**C**: Er, how 'bout "Biggles Combs his Hair"?

**P**: No, no, we don't have that one, funny!

**C**: "The Gospel According to Charley Drake"?

**P**: No, no, no, try me again!

**C**: Ah...oh, I know! "Ethel the Aardvark goes Quantity Surveying".

**P**: No, no, no, no, no,...What? WHAT??????

**C**: "Ethel the Aardvark goes Quantity Surveying".

**P**: "Ethel the Aa--" YES!!!YES!!! WE'VE GOT IT!! _(throwing books wildly about)_ I-I've seen it somewhere!!! I know it!!! Hee hee hee hee hee!!! Ha ha hoo ho---WAIT!! WAIT!! Is it?? Is it??? _(triumphant)_ YES!!!!!! Here we are, "Ethel the Aardvark goes Quantity Surveying"!!!!! There's your book!! _(throwing it down)_ Now, BUY IT!!!

**C**: _(quickly)_ I don't have enough money.

**P**: _(desperate)_ I'll take a deposit!

**C**: I don't have ANY money!

**P**: I'll take a check!!

**C**: I don't have a checkbook!

**P**: I've got a blank one!!

**C**: I don't have a bank account!!

**P**: RIGHT!!!! I'll buy it FOR you! _(ring)_ There we are, there's your change, there's some money for a taxi on the way home, there's your book, now, now..

**C**: Wait, wait, wait!

**P**: What? What?!? WHAT?!? WHAT???!!

**C**: I can't read!!!

**P**: _(staggeringly long pause; very quietly)_ You can't...read. _(pause)_ RIGHT!!! Sit down!! Sit down!! Sit!! Sit!! Are you sitting comfortably??? Right!!! _(opens book)_ "Ethel the Aardvark was hopping down the river valley one lovely morning, trottety-trottety-trottety, when she might a nice little quantity surveyor..."

_(fade out)_
