**M**: Well, it was coughin' up blood last night.

**K**: All right, I'll have the dead unjugged rabbit fish.

**M**: Aaw, you're always complainin'!

**K**: _(eyes lighting up)_ Strawberry tart?

**M**: Well, it's got *some* rat in it.

**K**: 'Ow much?

**M**: Three. A lot, really.

**K**: Well, I'll have a slice without so much rat in it.
 
_**Voice over**: One slice of strawberry tart without so much rat in it later:_

**M**: Moan, moan, moan!

**Son**: _(coming in the door)_ 'Ello Mum. 'Ello Dad.

**S**: There's a dead bishop on the landing, dad!

**K**: Really?

**M**: Where's it from?

**S**: Waddya mean?

**M**: What's its diocese?

**S**: Well, it looked a bit Bath and Wells-ish to me...

**K**: _(getting up and going out the door)_ I'll go and have a look.

**M**: I don't know who keeps bringin' 'em in here....

**S**: It's not me!

**M**: I've got three of 'em down by the bin, and the dustmen won't touch 'em!

**K**: _(coming back in)_ Leicester.

**M**: 'Ow d'you know?

**K**: Tattooed on the back o' the neck. I'll call the police.

**M**: Shouldn't you call the church?

**S**: Call the church police!

**K**: All right. _(shouting)_ THE CHURCH POLICE !!
 
_(sirens racing up, followed by a tremendous crash)_

_(the church police burst in the door)_
 
**Detective**: What's all this then, Amen!

**M**: Are you the church police?

**All the police officers**: (in unison) Ho, Yes!

**M**: There's another dead bishop on the landing, Vicar Sargeant!

**Detective**: Uh, Detective Parson, madam. I see... suffrican, or diocisian?

**M**: 'Ow should I know?

**D**: It's tatooed on the back o' their neck. _(spying the tart)_ 'Ere, is that.... *rat tart*?

**M**: yes.

_(pause)_

**D**: Disgusting! Right! Men, the chase is on! Now we should all kneel!

_(they all kneel)_

**All**: O Lord, we beseech thee, tell us 'oo croaked Leicester!

_(thunder)_

**Voice of the Lord**: The one in the braces, 'e done it!

**Klaus**: It's a fair cop, but society's to blame.

**Detective**: Agreed. We'll be charging them too.

**K**: I'd like you to take the three by the bin into consideration.

**D**: Right. I'll now ask you all to conclude this harrest with a hymn.

**All**: All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful, The church fuzz nicks them all. Amen.
