**Husband _(Terry Jones)_**:	Hello, my wife and I would like to buy a bed, please.

**Mr Lambert _(Graham Chapman)_**: Certainly sir, I'll get someone to help you.

**Wife _(Carol Cleveland)_**: Thank you.

**Lambert**: Mr Verity!

**Mr Verity _(Eric Idle)_**: Can I help you, sir?

**Husband**: Yes, we'd like a bed, a double bed, and I wondered if you'd got one for about fifty pounds.

**Verity**: Oh no, I'm afraid not, sir. Our cheapest bed is eight hundred pounds, sir.

**Husband & Wife**: Eight hundred pounds?

**Lambert**: Excuse me, sir, but before I go, I ought to have told you that Mr. Verity does tend to exaggerate. Every figure he gives you will be ten times too high.

**Husband**: I see.

**Lambert**: Otherwise he's perfectly all right.

**Husband**: I see. Er... your cheapest double bed then is eighty pounds?

**Verity**: Eight hundred pounds, yes, sir.

**Husband**: I see. And how wide is it?

**Verity**: It's sixty feet wide.

**Husband**: Yes...

**Wife**:	_(whispers)_ Sixty feet!

**Husband**: _(whispers)_ Six foot wide, you see.

**Wife**:	_(whispers)_ Oh.

**Husband**: ...and the length?

**Verity**: The length is ... er ... just a moment. Mr Lambert, what is the length of the Comfidown Majorette?

**Lambert**: Ah. Two foot long.

**Husband**: Two foot long?

**Verity**: Yes, remembering of course that you have to multiply everything Mr Lambert says by three. It's nothing he can help, you understand. Otherwise he's perfectly all right.

**Husband**: I see, I'm sorry.

**Verity**: But it does mean that when he says a bed is two foot long, it is in fact sixty foot long, all right?

**Husband**: Yes, I see.

**Verity**: That's without the mattress, of course.

**Husband**: How much is that?

**Verity**: Er, Mr Lambert will be able to tell you that. Lambert! Could you show these twenty good people the dog kennels, please?

**Husband**: Dog kennels? No, no, the mattresses!

**Verity**: I'm sorry, you have to say 'dog kennel' to Mr Lambert, because if you say 'mattress' he puts a bucket* over his head. I should have explained. Otherwise he's perfectly all right.

**Husband**: Oh. Ah. I see.  Er, excuse me, could you show us the dog kennels, please, hm?

**Lambert**: Dog kennels?

**Husband**: Yes, we want to look at the dog kennels, hm.

**Lambert**: Ah yes, well that's the pets' department, second floor.

**Husband**: No, no, no, we want to see the DOG KENNELS.

**Lambert _(irritated)_**: Yes, second floor.

**Husband**: No, we don't want to see dog kennels, it's just that Mr Verity said that...

**Lambert**: Oh dear, what's he been telling you now?

**Husband**: Well, he said we should say 'dog kennels' instead of saying 'mattresses'.
 
_(Lambert puts bucket on his head)_
 
**Husband**: Oh dear. Hello? Hello? Hello?

**Verity**: _(approaching)_ Did you say 'mattress'?

**Husband**: Well, yes, er...

**Lambert**: _(muffled)_ I'm not coming out!

**Verity**: I did *ask* you not to say 'mattress', didn't I?

**Husband**: But I mean, er...

**Lambert**: _(muffled)_ I'm not!

**Husband**: Oh.

**Verity**: Now I've got to get him to the fish tank and sing.

**Husband**: Oh.

**Verity**: _(sings)_ And did those feet, in ancient time...

**Another assistant _(John Cleese)_**: _(walking up, hearing the singing)_ Oh dear, did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert?

**Husband**: Yes, I did.

_(Assistant gives nasty look at Husband)_

**Verity**: _(still singing)_ ...walk upon England's mountains green... _(Assistant joins in)_ ...and was the Holy Lamb of God...
 
_(Lambert removes bucket; Verity and Assistant immediately stop singing; assistant leaves.)_
 
**Verity**: He should be all right now, but don't...you know...*don't*!

**Husband**: No, no. _(to Lambert)_ Excuse me, could we see the dog kennels please?

**Lambert**: _(irritated)_ Yes, pets department, second floor.

**Husband**: No, no, no. Those dog kennels, like that. You see?

**Lambert**: Mattresses?

**Husband**: _(relieved)_ Yes.

**Lambert**: But if you want a mattress, why not say 'mattress'?

**Husband**: _(nervously)_ Ha ha, I mean...

**Lambert**: I mean, it's a little confusing for me when you say 'dog kennel' if you want a mattress. Why not just say 'mattress'?

**Husband**: But you put a bucket over your head last time we said 'mattress'.
 
_(Lambert puts the bucket over his head again)_
 
**Verity**: (running on the scene again) Oh dear! _(sings)_ And did those feet...

**Assistant**: _(to Husband)_ We *did* ask! _(duet)_ ...in ancient times, walk upon England's mountains green...
 
_(singing continues throughout the next few lines of dialogue)_
 
**Yet another assistant _(Michael Palin)_**: (running in) Did somebody say 'mattress' to Mr Lambert?
 
_(Cleese points angrily towards the Husband and Wife)_
 
**Verity**: *Twice*!

**Other Assistant**: _(shouting throughout the store)_ Hey, everybody! Somebody said 'mattress' to Mr Lambert -- *twice*! _(joins in the singing)_
 
_(Organ music swells and they carry on singing)_
 
**Verity**: It's not working, we need more!
 
_(The entire Mormon Tabernacle Choir begins to sing in the background. Sounds of water splashing; eventually Lambert removes the bucket again and they stop singing)_
 
**Lambert**: I'm sorry, can I help you?

**Wife**:	_(brightly)_ We want a mattress!
 
_(Lambert puts the bucket over his head again. Verity, husband and assistants all groan and glare accusingly at wife)_
 
**Wife**:	But it's my only line!!!
 
*N.B.  In the television version it was a paper bag, on the record it was a bucket (better sound effects?)
