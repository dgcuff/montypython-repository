**Customer**: Hello, is this the Barbershop Sketch?

**Barber**: Y-y-yes sir. B-b-b-be with you in a minute.
 
_(The barber is now washing and re-washing his hands, trying to remove the obvious blood-stains from them and his coat.)_
 
**Barber**: H-h-how would you like it sir?

**Customer**: Just short back and sides.

**Barber**: How do you do that?

**Customer**: Oh, you know, just short back and sides.

**Barber**: It's not a.. a razor cut, RAZOR CUT BLOOD ARTERY MURDER SPUrt..arr...

**Customer**: No, just ordinary short back and sides, you know...

**Barber**: It's just s-s-s-scissors then...

**Customer**: Yes.

**Barber**: You wouldn't rather forget all about it?

**Customer**: What?

**Barber**: You wouldn't prefer to have it just combed?

**Customer**: Oh, no.. I want something cut off!

**Barber**: Cut, CUT HEART HITCHCOCK MURDER BLOOD PSYCHO HOMICIDE SPURT ARTERY TREMOR CORTEX Arrrgg...!
 
_(The barber fakes a few quick snips.)_
 
**Barber**: There, finished.

**Customer**: I beg your pardon?

**Barber**: I've finished cutting, cutting, CUTTING, CUTTING YOUR HAIR!

**Customer**: Well, you haven't even done any cutting yet.

**Barber**: All right, I confess I didn't cut your hair. I hate hair. I-I I can't bear cutting it. I have this uncontrolable fear whenever I see hair. My mother said I was a fool! She said the only way to overcome my fear would be to become a barber. I didn't want to be a barber.

**Barber**: I wanted to be... A [*LUMBERJACK*](../lumberjack)!
