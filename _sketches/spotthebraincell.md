**Ratbag**: Yes, just there, where it hurts.

**Quizmaster**: Jolly good! Well now Madam your first question for the blow on the head this evening is: Which great opponent of Cartesian dualism resists the reduction of psychological phenomena to a physical state and insists there is no point of contact between the extended and the unextended?

**Ratbag**: Oh, yes please, Michael.

**Quizmaster**: _(Deliberate Pause)_ I'm offering you a poke in the eye...

**Ratbag**: No no.

**Quizmaster**: All right then, a punch in the throat.

**Ratbag**: No.

**Quizmaster**: My very last offer Mrs. Scum -- a knee in the temple and a dagger up the clitoris! _(Piano)_
