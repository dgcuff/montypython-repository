## From "Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl"
### Transcribed by Dave Bregman

---

Sit on my face, and tell me that you love me.\
I'll sit on your face and tell you I love you, too.\
I love to hear you moralize,\
When I'm between your thighs;\
You blow me away!

Sit on my face and let my lips embrace you.\
I'll sit on your face and let my love be truly.\
Life can be fine if we both sixty-nine,\
And we'll sit on our faces in all sorts of places and play,\
'Till we're blown away!
