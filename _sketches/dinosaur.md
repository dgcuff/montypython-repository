**Television Host _(Graham Chapman)_**: Good evening. Tonight - dinosaurs. I have here sitting in the studio next to me an elk. Aaagghhhh! Oh, I'm sorry, Anne Elk, Mrs. Anne Elk.

**Miss Elk _(John Cleese, as a very prim lady)_**: Miss.

**Host**: Miss Anne Elk, who is an expert on the...

**Elk**: No, no, no, Anne Elk.

**Host**: What?

**Elk**: Anne Elk, not Anne Expert.

**Host**: No, no, I was saying that you, Miss Elk, were an, A.N. not A.N.N.E., expert...

**Elk**: Oh!

**Host**: ...on elks - I'm sorry, on dinosaurs.

**Elk**: Yes, I certainly am, Chris, how very true, my word yes!

**Host**: Now, Miss Elk - Anne - you have a new theory about the brontosaurus.

**Elk**: Could I just say, Chris, for one moment that I have a new theory about the brontosaurus?

**Host**: Er... exactly. What is it?

**Elk**: Where?

**Host**: No, no, no. What is your theory?

**Elk**: Oh, what is my theory?

**Host**: Yes.

**Elk**: Oh what is my theory, that it is. Yes, well you may well ask, what is my theory.

**Host**: _(slightly impatient)_ I am asking.

**Elk**: And well you may. Yes my word you may well ask what it is, this theory of mine. Well, this theory that I have--that is to say, which is mine--...is mine.

**Host**: _(more impatient)_ I know it's yours. What is it?

**Elk**: Where? Oh, what is my theory?

**Host**: Yes!

**Elk**: Oh, my theory that I have follows the lines I am about to relate. _(Coughs)_ Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem.

**Host**: Oh God.

**Elk**: Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. _[Impatient noises from Host]_ The Theory, by A. Elk. That's A for Anne, it's not by a elk.

**Host**: Right....

**Elk**: This theory which belongs to me is as follows. Ahem. Ahem. This is how it goes. Ahem. The next thing that I am about to say is my theory. Ahem. Ready?

_(Host moans)_

**Elk**: The Theory by A. Elk brackets Miss brackets.  My theory is along the following lines.

**Host**: Oh God.

**Elk**: All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much MUCH thicker in the middle, and then thin again at the far end. That is the theory that I have and which is mine, and what it is too.

**Host**: That's it, is it?

**Elk**: Right, Chris.

**Host**: Well, Anne, this theory of yours seems to have hit the nail on the head.

**Elk**: And it's mine.

**Host**: _(ironical)_ Thank you for coming along to the studio.

**Elk**: My pleasure, Chris.

**Host**: Er...Britain's newest wasp farm...

**Elk**: It's been a lot of fun.

**Host**: ...opened last week...

**Elk**: Saying what my theory is.

**Host**: Yes, thank you.

**Elk**: And whose it is.

**Host**: Yes. ...opened last week...

**Elk**: I have another theory.

**Host**: Not today, thank you.

**Elk**: My theory number two, which is the second theory that I have. Ahem! This theory...

**Host**: Oh look...shut up!

**Elk**: ...is what I am about to say...

**Host**: Oh please shut up!

**Elk**: ...which, with what I have said, are the two theories that are mine and belong to me.

**Host**: Look, if you don't shut up I shall shoot you.

**Elk**: Ahem! My brace of theories, which I possess the ownership of, which belongs to me...
 
_(BANG!)_
 
_(Pause)_
 
**Elk**: Ahem. The Theory the Second by Anne...
