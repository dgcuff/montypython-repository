## From "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
### Transcribed by Jonathan Partington

**Scene**: a 1920s-style drawing room

**Chapman**: I say!

**Cleveland**: Yes, Daddy?

**Chapman**: Croquet hoops look dam' pretty this afternoon.

**Cleveland**: Frightfully damn pretty.

**Idle _(as her mother)_**: They're coming along *awfully* well this year.

**Chapman**: Yes, better than your Aunt Lavinia's croquet hoops.

**Cleveland**: Ugh! Dreadful tin things.

**Idle**: I did tell her to stick to wood.

**Chapman**: Yes, you can't beat wood. Gorn.

**Idle**: What's gone, dear?

**Chapman**: Nothing, nothing -- just like the word, it gives me confidence. Gorn. Gorn -- it's got a sort of *woody* quality about it. Gorn. Go-o-orn. Much better than 'newspaper' or 'litter bin'.

**Cleveland**: Ugh! Frightful words!

**Idle**: Perfectly dreadful!

**Chapman**: 'Newspaper' -- 'litter bin' -- 'litter bin' -- dreadful *tinny* sort of word.

_(Cleveland screams)_

**Chapman**: Tin, tin, tin.

**Idle**: Oh, don't say 'tin' to Rebecca, you know how it upsets her.

**Chapman**: Sorry, old horse.

**Idle**: 'Sausage.'

**Chapman**: 'Sausage'! There's a good woody sort of word, 'sausage'. 'Gorn.'

**Cleveland**: 'Antelope!'

**Chapman**: Where? On the lawn?

**Cleveland**: No, no, Daddy. Just the word.

**Chapman**: Don't want antelope nibbling the hoops.

**Cleveland**: No, no -- 'ant-e-lope'. Sort of nice and woody type of thing.

**Idle**: Don't think so, Becky old chap.

**Chapman**: No, no -- 'antelope' - 'antelope', *tinny* sort of word.

_(Cleveland screams)_

**Chapman**: Oh, sorry old man.

**Idle**: Really, Mansfield.

**Chapman**: Well, she's got to come to terms with these things. 'Seemly.' 'Prodding.' 'Vac-u-um.' 'Leap.'

**Cleveland**: Oh -- hate 'leap'.

**Idle**: Perfectly dreadful.

**Cleveland**: Sort of PVC sort of word, don't you know.

**Idle**: Lower middle.

**Chapman**: 'Bound!'

**Idle**: Now you're talking!

**Chapman**: 'Bound.' 'Vole!' 'Recidivist!'

**Idle**: Bit *tinny*...

_(Cleveland screams and rushes out sobbing)_

**Idle**: Oh, sorry, Becky old beast.

**Chapman**: Oh dear, I suppose she'll be gorn for a few days now.

**Idle**: Caribou.

**Chapman**: Splendid word!

**Idle**: No, dear, nibbling the hoops.

_(Chapman fires a shotgun)_

**Chapman**: _(with satisfaction)_ Caribou -- gorn... 'Intercourse.'

**Idle**: Later, dear.

**Chapman**: No, no -- the word, 'intercourse'. Good and woody. 'Inter-course.' 'Pert,' 'pert,' 'thighs,' 'botty,' 'botty,' 'botty' _(getting excited)_, 'erogenous zo-o-one'. Ha ha ha ha -- oh, 'concubine', 'erogenous zo-o-one', 'loose woman', 'erogenous zone'...

_(Idle calmly empties a bucket of water over Chapman)_

**Chapman**: Oh, thank you, dear. There's a funny thing, dear -- all the naughty words sound woody.

**Idle**: Really, dear -- how about 'tit'?

**Chapman**: Oh dear, I hadn't thought about that. 'Tit.' 'Tit.' Oh, that's very tinny, isn't it? 'Tit.' 'Tit.' Tinny, tinny.

_(Cleveland, who has just come in, screams and rushes out again)_

**Chapman**: Oh dear. 'Ocelot.' 'Was-p.' 'Yowling.' Oh dear, I'm bored. Better go and have a bath, I suppose.

**Idle**: Oh really, must you, dear -- you've had nine today.

**Chapman**: All right -- I'll sack one of the servants. Simpkins! Nasty tinny sort of name. SIMPKINS!

_(Enter Palin, in RAF uniform)_

**Palin**: I say, mater, cabbage crates coming over the briny.

**Idle**: Sorry dear, don't understand.

**Palin**: Er -- cow-catchers creeping up on the conning towers?

**Idle**: No, sorry old sport.

**Palin**: Um -- caribou nibbling at the croquet hoops.

**Idle**: Yes, Mansfield shot one in the antlers.
