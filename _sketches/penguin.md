**Voice Over**: Number ninety-seven: a radio.

**Radio Announcer**: And now the BBC is proud to present a brand new radio drama series, "The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots." Part One: The Beginning.

_(music)_

**Man's voice**: Yoo arrr Mary, Queen of Scots?

**Woman's voice**: I am!

_(sound of violent blows being dealt, things being smashed, awful crunching noises, bones being broken, and other bodily harm being inflicted. All of this accompanied by screaming from the woman.)_

_(music fades up and out)_

**Announcer**: Stay tuned for part two of the Radio Four Production of "The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots", coming up...almost immediately.

_(music)_

_(sound of saw cutting, and other violent sounds as before, with the woman screaming. Suddenly it is silent.)_

**Man's voice**: I think she's dead.

**Woman's voice**: No I'm not!

_(sounds of physical harm and screaming start again.)_

_(music fades up and out)_

**Announcer**: that was episode two of "The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots", specially adapted for radio by Gracie Fields and Joe Frazier. And now, Radio Four will explode.

_(music)_

_(The radio explodes.)_

_(Two old women are sitting on the couch listening to the radio when it explodes. One looks at the other:)_

**1**: We'll have to watch the Telly-vision!

**2**: Aaaaw. _(sound of agreement)_

_(they turn the couch so it's facing the television. One turns the television on, and they sit down. There is a small penguin sitting on top of the television set.)_

**1 & 2**: _(singing, mumbled)_ hhmhmhmhmh... mhmmhmh mhmhm hhmhmmhm mhmhmmhmhmh

**1**: What's that on top of the telly-vision set?

(pause)

**2**: _(matter-of-factly)_ Looks like a penguin.

_(pause)_

**2**: It's been a long time there, now, has it?

**1**: What's it doin' there?

**2**: Standin'!

**1**: I can see that!

_(pause)_

**1**: If it laid an egg, it would roll down the back of the telly-vision set.

**2**: Ummmm. I hadn't thought of that.

**1**: Unless it's a male.

**2**: Yes. It looks fairly butch.

_(pause)_

**1**: Per'aps it's from next door.

**2**: _(yelling)_ NEXT DOOR?!? Penguins don't come from NEXT DOOR! They come from the Antarctic!

**1**: _(yet louder)_ BURMA!!!

_(they both stop short, looking around)_

**2**: Why'd'j say that?

**1**: I panicked.

**2**: Oh.

**1**: Per'aps it's from the zoo.

**2**: Which zoo?

**1**: _(angrily)_ 'ow should I know which zoo it's from?!? I'm not Doctor bloody Bernofsky!!

**2**: 'Oo's Doctor bloody Bernofsky?

**1**: He knows everything.

**2**: Oooh, I wouldn't like that, that'd take all the mystery out of life.

_(pause)_

**2**: Besides, if it were from the zoo, it'd have "property of the zoo" stamped on it.

**1**: They don't stamp animals "property of the zoo"!! You can't stamp a huge lion "property of the zoo"!!

**2**: _(confidently)_ They stamp them when they're small.

**1**: _(snapping back)_ What happens when they moult?

**2**: Lions don't moult.

**1**: No, but penguins do. THERE! I've run rings around you logically.

**2**: _(looks at the camera)_ OOOOH! INTERCOURSE THE PENGUIN!!!

_(The television warms up: a man is sitting behind a news desk)_

**Man**: Hello! Well, it's just after eight o'clock, and time for the penguin on top of your television set to explode.

_(the penguin explodes)_

**1**: 'Ow did 'e know that was going to happen?!

**Man**: It was an educated guess. And now:

**Voice Over**: Number ninety-eight: the nape of the neck.
