**Scene**: A tobacconist's shop.
 
**Text on screen**: In 1970, the British Empire lay in ruins, and foreign nationalists frequented the streets - many of them Hungarians _(not the streets - the foreign nationals)_. Anyway, many of these Hungarians went into tobacconist's shops to buy cigarettes....

**Scene**: A Hungarian tourist _(John Cleese)_ approaches the clerk _(Terry Jones)_. The tourist is reading haltingly from a phrase book.

**Hungarian**: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.

**Clerk**: Sorry?

**Hungarian**: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.

**Clerk**: Uh, no, no, no. This is a tobacconist's.

**Hungarian**: Ah! I will not buy this *tobacconist's*, it is scratched.

**Clerk**: No, no, no, no. Tobacco...um...cigarettes (holds up a pack).

**Hungarian**: Ya! See-gar-ets! Ya! Uh...My hovercraft is full of eels.

**Clerk**: Sorry?

**Hungarian**: My hovercraft _(pantomimes puffing a cigarette)_...is full of eels _(pretends to strike a match)_.

**Clerk**: Ahh, matches!

**Hungarian**: Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Do you waaaaant...do you waaaaaant...to come back to my place, bouncy bouncy?

**Clerk**: Here, I don't think you're using that thing right.

**Hungarian**: You great poof.

**Clerk**: That'll be six and six, please.

**Hungarian**: If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me? I...I am no longer infected.

**Clerk**: Uh, may I, uh..._(takes phrase book, flips through it)_...Costs six and six...ah, here we are. _(speaks weird Hungarian-sounding words)_

_(Hungarian punches the clerk.)_

**Scene**: Meanwhile, a policeman _(Graham Chapman)_ on a quiet street cups his ear as if hearing a cry of distress. He sprints for many blocks and finally enters the tobacconist's.

**Cop**: What's going on here then?

**Hungarian**: Ah. You have beautiful thighs.

**Cop**: _(looks down at himself)_ WHAT?!?

**Clerk**: He hit me!

**Hungarian**: Drop your panties, Sir William; I cannot wait 'til lunchtime.

_(points at clerk)_

**Cop**: RIGHT!!! _(drags Hungarian away by the arm)_

**Hungarian**: _(indignantly)_ My nipples explode with delight!

**Scene**: A courtroom. Characters are all in powdered wigs and judicial robes, except publisher and cop. Characters:\
_Judge: Terry Jones_\
_Bailiff Eric Idle_\
_Lawyer: John Cleese_\
_Cop: Graham Chapman_\
_Publisher: Michael Palin_

**Bailiff**: Call Alexander Yalt!

_(voices sing out the name several times)_

**Judge**: Oh, shut up!

**Bailiff**: _(to publisher)_ You are Alexander Yalt?

**Publisher**: _(in a sing-songy voice)_ Oh, I am.

**Bailiff**: Skip the impersonations. You are Alexander Yalt?

**Publisher**: I am.

**Bailiff**: You are hereby charged that on the 28th day of May, 1970, you did willfully, unlawfully, and with malice of forethought, publish an alleged English-Hungarian phrase book with intent to cause a breach of the peace. How do you plead?

**Publisher**: Not guilty.

**Bailiff**: You live at 46 Horton Terrace?

**Publisher**: I do live at 46 Horton terrace.

**Bailiff**: You are the director of a publishing company?

**Publisher**: I am the director of a publishing company.

**Bailiff**: Your company publishes phrase books?

**Publisher**: My company does publish phrase books.

**Bailiff**: You did say 46 Horton Terrace, did you?

**Publisher**: Yes.

**Bailiff**: _(strikes a gong)_ Ah! Got him!

_(lawyer and cop applaud, laugh)_

**Judge**: Get on with it, get on with it.

**Bailiff**: That's fine. On the 28th of May, you published this phrase book.

**Publisher**: I did.

**Bailiff**: I quote on example. The Hungarian phrase meaning "Can you direct me to the station?" is translated by the English phrase, "Please fondle my bum."

**Publisher**: I wish to plead incompetence.

**Cop**: _(stands)_ Please may I ask for an adjournment, m'lord?

**Judge**: An adjournment? Certainly not!

_(the cop sits down again, emitting perhaps the longest and loudest release of bodily gas in the history of the universe.)_

**Judge**: Why on earth didn't you say WHY you wanted an adjournment?

**Cop**: I didn't know an acceptable legal phrase, m'lord.

_(cut to ancient footage of old women applauding)_

**Judge**: _(banging + swinging gavel)_ If there's any more stock film of women applauding, I'll clear the court.
