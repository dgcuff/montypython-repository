I want another slice of rhubarb tart.\
I want another lovely slice.\
I'm not disparaging the blueberry pie,\
But rhubarb tart is oh so very nice.\
A rhubarb what? A rhubarb tart!\
A whatbarb tart? A rhubarb tart!\
I want another slice of rhubarb tart!

The principles of modern philosophy\
Were postulated by Descartes.\
Discarding everything he wasn't certain of\
He said 'I think therefore I am a rhubarb tart.'\
A rhubarb what? A rhubarb tart!\
A Rene who? Rene Descartes!\
Poor nut he thought he was a rhubarb tart!

Read all the existentialist philosophers,\
Like Schopenhauer and Jean-Paul Sartre.\
Even Martin Heidegger agrees on one thing:\
Eternal happiness is rhubarb tart.\
A rhubarb what? A rhubarb tart!\
A Jean-Paul who? A Jean-Paul Sartre!\
Eternal happiness is rhubarb tart.

A rhubarb tart has fascinated all the poets.\
Especially the immortal bard.\
He caused Richard the Third to call on Bosworth Field:\
'My kingdom for a slice of rhubarb tart!'\
A rhubarb what? A rhubarb bard!\
Immortal what? Immortal tart!\
As rhymes go that is really pretty bard!
