## From "Monty Python's Contractual Obligations Album"
### Transcribed by R. "Gumby" Preston

**MAN**: _(entering a shop)_ Um, excuse me, is this the undertaker's?

**UNDERTAKER**: Yup, that's right, what can I do for you, squire?

**M**: Um, well, I wonder if you can help me. My mother has just died and I'm not quite sure what I should do.

**U**: Ah, well, we can 'elp you. We deal with stiffs.

**M**: _(aghast)_ Stiffs?

**U**: Yea. Now there's three things we can do with your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her.

**M**: Dump her?

**U**: Dump her in the Thames.

**M**: _(still aghast)_ What?

**U**: Oh, did you like her?

**M**: Yes!

**U**: Oh well, we won't dump her, then. Well, what do you think: burn her, or bury her?

**M**: Um, well, um, which would you recommend?

**U**: Well they're both nasty. If we burn her, she gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead. But quick. And then you get a box of ashes, which you can pretend are hers.

**M**: _(timidly)_ Oh.

**U**: Or, if you don't wanna fry her, you can bury her. And then she'll get eaten up by maggots and weevils, nibble, nibble, nibble, which isn't so hot if, as I said, she's not quite dead.

**M**: I see. Um. Well, I.. I.. I.. I'm not very sure. She's definitely dead.

**U**: Where is she?

**M**: In the sack.

**U**: Let's 'ave a look.

_(FX: rustle of bag opening)_

**U**: Umm, she looks quite young.

**M**: Yes, she was.

**U**: _(over his shoulder)_ FRED!

**F**: _(offstage)_ Yea!

**U**: I THINK WE'VE GOT AN EATER!

**F**: _(offstage)_ I'll get the oven on!

**M**: Um, er...excuse me, um, are you... are you suggesting we should eat my mother?

_(pause)_

**U**: Yeah. Not raw, not raw. We cook her. She'd be delicious with a few french fries, a bit of stuffing. Delicious! _(smacks his lips)_

**M**: What! _(he stammers)_

_(pause)_

**M**: Actually, I do feel a bit peckish - No! NO, I can't!

**U**: Look, we'll eat your mum. Then, if you feel a bit guilty about it afterwards, we can dig a grave and you can throw up into it.

**M**: All right.
