**Host _(Eric Idle)_**: Last week the Royal Festival Hall saw the first performance of a new symphony by one of the world's leading modern composers, Arthur 'Two sheds' Jackson. Mr Jackson.

**Jackson _(Terry Jones)_**: Hello.

**Host**: May I just sidetrack for one moment. This -- what shall I call it -- nickname of yours...

**Jackson**: Ah yes.

**Host**: "Two sheds". How did you come by it?

**Jackson**: Well, I don't use it myself, but some of my friends call me "Two Sheds".

**Host**: And do you in fact have two sheds?

**Jackson**: No, I've only got one. I've had one for some time, but a few year ago I said I was thinking of getting another, and since then some people have called me "Two Sheds".

**Host**: In spite of the fact that you only have one.

**Jackson**: Yes.

**Host**: And are you still intending to purchase this second shed?

**Jackson**: _(impatient)_ No!

**Host**: ...To bring you in line with your epithet?

**Jackson**: No.

**Host**: I see, I see. Well to return to your symphony.

**Jackson**: Ah yes.

**Host**: Did you write this symphony in the shed?

**Jackson**: _(surprised)_ No!

**Host**: Have you written any of your recent works in this shed of yours?

**Jackson**: No, no, not at all. It's just an ordinary garden shed.

**Host**: I see, I see.	And you're thinking of buying this second shed to write in!

**Jackson**: No, no. Look. This shed business -- it doesn't really matter. The sheds aren't important. A few friends call me Two Sheds and that's all there is to it. I wish you'd ask me about the music. Everybody talks about the sheds. They've got it out of proportion -- I'm a composer. I'm going to get rid of the shed. I'm fed up with it!

**Host**:	Then you'll be Arthur 'No Sheds' Jackson, eh?

**Jackson**: Look, forget about the sheds. They don't matter.

**Host**: _(sternly)_:_ Mr. Jackson, I think, with respect, we ought to return to the subject of your symphony.

**Jackson**:What?

**Host**:	Apprently your symphony was written for tympani and organ....

_(Picture of a shed appears on the screen behind them)_

**Jackson**: _(turning around)_ What's that!?!?!???

**Host**: _(innocently)_ What's what?

**Jackson**: Its a shed!!...get it off!! get it off!!

_(Interviewer motions to picture, and it is replaced by a picture of Jackson him self)_

**Jackson**: _(Grudgingly)_ All right...Thats better..

**Host**: I understand that you used to be interested in train-spotting.

**Jackson**: What?

**Host**: I understand that, about thirty years ago, you were interested in train-spotting.

**Jackson**: Well what's that got to do with my bloody music?

**John Cleese**: _(entering)_ Are you having any trouble with him?

**Host**: Yes, a little. Good Lord! You're the man who interviewed Sir Edward Ross earlier.

**Cleese**: Exactly. Well we interviewers are more than a match for the likes of you, "Two Sheds".

**Host**: Yes, make yourself scarce, "Two Sheds". This studio isn't big enough for the three of us!

_(They throw him out.)_

**Jackson**: Here, what are you doing? Stop it! _(Crash.)_

**Cleese**: Get your own Arts programme, you fairy!

**Host**: Arthur "Two Sheds" Jackson... Never mind, Timmy.

**Cleese**: Oh Mike, you're such a comfort.
