## From Monty Python's Contractual Obligations Album
### Transcribed by R. "Gumby" Preston

---

All things dull and ug-ly,\
All creatures, short and squat,\
All things rude and na-sty,\
The Lord God made the lot.
 
Each little snake that poisons,\
Each little wasp that stings,\
He made their prudish venom,\
He made their horrid wings.
 
All things sick and cancerous,\
All evil great and small,\
All things foul and dangerous,\
The Lord God made them all.
 
Each nasty little hornet,\
Each beastly little squid,\
Who made the spiky urchin?\
Who made the sharks? He did!
 
All things scant and ulcerous,\
All pox both great and small,\
Putrid, foul and gangrenous,\
The Lord God made them all.
 
Amen.
