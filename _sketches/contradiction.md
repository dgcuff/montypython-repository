## From "Monty Python's Previous Record"
### Transcribed by Jonathan Partington

**Host _(John Cleese)_**:  With me now is Norman St. John Polevaulter, who for the last few years has been contradicting people. St. John Polevaulter, why do you contradict people?

**Polevaulter _(Graham Chapman)_**: I don't!

**Host**:	But you... you told me that you did.

**Polevaulter**: I most certainly did not!

**Host**:	Oh. I see. I'll start again.

**Polevaulter**: No you won't!

**Host**:	Ssh! I understand you don't contradict people.

**Polevaulter**: Yes I do!

**Host**:	And when didn't you start contradicting them?

**Polevaulter**: I did! In 1952!

**Host**:	1952.

**Polevaulter**: 1947!

**Host**:	23 years ago.

**Polevaulter**: No!
