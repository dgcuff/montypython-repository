**Scene**: a wartime RAF station
 
**Jones**: Morning, Squadron Leader.

**Idle**: What-ho, Squiffy.

**Jones**: How was it?

**Idle**: Top-hole. Bally Jerry, pranged his kite right in the how's-your-father; hairy blighter, dicky-birded, feathered back on his sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harpers and caught his can in the Bertie.

**Jones**: Er, I'm afraid I don't quite follow you, Squadron Leader.

**Idle**: It's perfectly ordinary banter, Squiffy. Bally Jerry, pranged his kite right in the how's-your-father; hairy blighter, dicky-birded, feathered back on his sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harpers and caught his can in the Bertie.

**Jones**: No, I'm just not understanding banter at all well today. Give us it slower.

**Idle**: Banter's not the same if you say it slower, Squiffy.

**Jones**: Hold on then -- Wingco! -- just bend an ear to the Squadron Leader's banter for a sec, would you?

**Chapman**: Can do.

**Jones**: Jolly good. Fire away.

**Idle**:	Bally Jerry... _(he goes through it all again)_

**Chapman**: No, I don't understand that banter at all.

**Idle**:	Something up with my banter, chaps?
 
**GRAMS**: AIR RAID SIRENS

_(Enter Palin, out of breath)_
 
**Palin**: Bunch of monkeys on the ceiling, sir! Grab your egg-and-fours and let's get the bacon delivered!

**Chapman _(to Idle)_**: Do *you* understand that?

**Idle**: No -- I didn't get a word of it.

**Chapman**: Sorry, old man, we don't understand your banter.

**Palin**: You know -- bally tenpenny ones dropping in the custard!

_(no reaction)_

**Palin**: Um -- Charlie choppers chucking a handful!

**Chapman**: No no -- sorry.

**Jones**: Say it slower, old chap.

**Palin**: Slower *banter*, sir?

**Chapman**: Ra-ther.

**Palin**: Um -- sausage squad up the blue end?

**Idle**: No, still don't get it.

**Palin**: Um -- cabbage crates coming over the briny?

**The others**: No, no.
 
_(Film of air-raid)_
 
**Idle (voice-over)**: But by then it was too late. The first cabbage crates hit London on July the 7th. That was just the beginning.
 
_(Chapman seen sitting at desk, on telephone)_
 
**Chapman**: Five shillings a dozen? That's ordinary cabbages, is it? And what about the bombs?... Good Lord, they _are_ expensive.
