_Toothless old CRONE by the roadside. ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and two PAGES ride up and draw up alongside the CRONE._

**ARTHUR**: Is there anywhere where we could buy a shrubbery?

_The OLD CRONE crosses herself with a look of stark terror._

**CRONE**: Who sent you?

**ARTHUR**: The Knights Who Say Ni!

**CRONE**: Aaaagh! (she looks around in rear) No! We have no shrubberies here.

**BEDEVERE**: Surely, there must be.

<span>~~_ARTHUR restrains from threatening the LADY._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR** _(aside)_: It will be not good to argue. These simple people are terrified of the Knights Who Say Ni!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**CRONE** _(she cowers)_: Ohhh!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_ARTHUR takes BEDEVERE further aside._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: There is only one way to get the information we want ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE**: Send her a letter from a long way away?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: Er, no ... no, we must ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE**: Talk to her in funny voices?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR** _(slightly crossly)_: No ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE**: How about trying ourselves to a tree?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR** _(grittily)_: No. Our only hope is to make her as afraid of us as she is of the awful Knights Who Say Ni!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE** _(sagely)_: Ah! Hit ourselves with a big rock ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_He nods knowingly._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR** _(tolerantly but firmly)_: No. Nothing we do to ourselves will frighten her as much as what we can do to her ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE**: Ah!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: We must threaten to say "Ni"!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE** _(terror)_: Oh, no.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_They reapproach the OLD CRONE who is cowering more than ever._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

**ARTHUR**: Listen, old crone! Unless you tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will ... we will say "Ni"!

**CRONE**: Do your worst!

<span>~~**CRONE**: I have herd the Knights say "Ni"! in the night. I have herd the hideous Peng! and they have said "Nee-wum"! to my sister but still I have not revealed ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

**ARTHUR**: Very well, old crone. Since you will not assist us voluntarily ... "Ni"!

**CRONE**: No. Never. No shrubberies.

**ARTHUR**: Ni!

**BEDEVERE**: Nu!

**ARTHUR**: No. Ni! More like this. "Ni"!

**BEDEVERE**: Ni, ni, ni!

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: It's not working.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>**ARTHUR**: You're not doing it properly. Ni!</span>{: .notice--success}

**BEDEVERE**: Ni!

**ARTHUR**: That's it. Ni! Ni!

_A PASSER-BY on a horse is observing them._

**ROGER**: Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?

**ARTHUR**: Erm, yes.

**ROGER**: Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say "Ni" at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land! nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this point in time.

**ARTHUR**: Did you say shrubberies?

**ROGER**: Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name is Roger the Shrubber. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

**BEDEVERE** _(rather aggressively, to ROGER)_: Ni!

**ARTHUR**: No. No. No!
