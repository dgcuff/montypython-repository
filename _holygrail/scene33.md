_The KNIGHTS emerge from the mouth of the cave to find themselves in a breathtaking, barren landscape. Glencoe. They are half they way up the side of a mountain. They rest a few seconds and get their breath back._

**GALAHAD**: Look!

<span>**GALAHAD**: There it is!</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**ARTHUR**: The Bridge of Death!</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**ROBIN** _(to himself)_: Oh! Great ...</span>{: .notice--success}

_They look and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone which bears the words: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 5 miles" and an arrow._

**ARTHUR**: God be praised. This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke in scene twenty-four.

_The KNIGHTS set off along and rather perilous track edging along the side of the mountain. GALAHAD is leading._

_MIX THROUGH they are climbing higher. The path gets more and more slippery and dangerous. They reach another milestone which says: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 4 miles" and an arrow, and "Ni! 82 miles" and an arrow pointing in the opposite direction. They go on. It is dangerous and difficult. Tension in their faces._

_As they are climbing, BEDEVERE turns to ROBIN and ARTHUR._

**BEDEVERE**: We must find the bridge ... the Bridge of Death ...

**ROBIN** _(to himself)_: Oh, great!

**BEDEVERE**: The Bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper, who asks each traveler three questions. And he who answers the three questions can cross in safety.

**ROBIN** _(warily)_: And if you get a question wrong?

**BEDEVERE**: You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
