_CUT TO the glade in the forest again._

**ARTHUR**: Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery. May we go now?

![Knights With Shrubbery](/images/knights3.jpg){: .align-right}

**TALL KNIGHT**: That is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.

**ARTHUR**: What is that?

**TALL KNIGHT**: We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!

**ONE KNIGHT**: Ni!

**OTHERS**: Sh!

**ONE KNIGHT** _(whispers)_: Sorry.

**TALL KNIGHT**: We are now the Knights Who Go Neeeow ... wum ... ping!

**OTHERS**: Ni!

**OTHERS**: Ni!

**ONE KNIGHT**: Peng!

**OTHERS**: Ni!

**OTHERS**: Sh! Sh!

**TALL KNIGHT**: Therefore ... we are no longer contractually bound by any agreements previously entered into by the Knights Who Say Ni!

**ONE KNIGHT**: Ni!

**ANOTHER**: Peng!

**ANOTHER**: Sh!

**TALL KNIGHT**: Shut up!

**TALL KNIGHT** _(to ARTHUR)_:_ Therefore, we must give you a test, a Test to satisfy the Knights who say Neeeow ... wum ... ping!

**OTHERS** _(terrific chorus)_: Neeeow ... wum ... ping!

**ARTHUR**: What is this test, Knights of N... _(can't say it)_ ... Recently Knights of Ni!

**KNIGHT**: Ni!

**TALL KNIGHT**: Firstly. You must get us another shrubbery!

**OTHER KNIGHTS** _(half seen)_: More shrubberies! More shrubberies for the ex-Knights of Ni!

**ARTHUR**: Not another shrubbery -

**TALL KNIGHT**: When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: A path! A little path for the late Knights of Ni!

_Chorus of "Ni! Ni!"_

**TALL KNIGHT**: When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: Yes! With a herring! With a herring! Cut down with a herring!

**ARTHUR**: We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!

**TALL KNIGHT**: Oh, please!

**ARTHUR**: Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done!

**OTHER KNIGHTS** _(they all recoil in horror)_: Oh!

**TALL KNIGHT**: Don't say that word.

**ARTHUR**: What word?

**TALL KNIGHT**: I cannot tell you. Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!

**ARTHUR**: How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?

**TALL KNIGHT** _(cringing in fear)_: You said it again!

**ARTHUR**: What, "is"?

**TALL KNIGHT** _(dismissively)_: No, no ... not "is"!

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: Not "is"! Not "is"!

_Suddenly singing is heard from deep in the forest._

**SIR ROBIN'S SINGERS**: Bravely good Sir Robin was not at all afraid To have his eyeballs skewered ...

**TALL KNIGHT** _(irritated)_: "Is" is all right ... You wouldn't get far not saying "Is"!

**BEDEVERE**: My liege, it's Sir Robin!

**TALL KNIGHT** _(covering his ears)_: You've said the word again!

_SIR ROBIN and his SINGERS appear in the clearing. The SINGERS are going on cheerfully as usual and ROBIN walks in front of them, continually embarrassed at their presence._

**SINGERS**: ... and his kidneys burnt and his nipples skewered off ...

_ROBIN holds his hand up for silence._

**ARTHUR**: Sir Robin!

_He shakes his hand warmly._

**ROBIN**: My liege! It's good to have found you again ...

**TALL KNIGHT**: Now he's said the word!

**ARTHUR**: Where are you going good Sir Robin?

**ROBIN'S SINGERS** _(starting up again)_: He was going home ... he was giving up, He was throwing in the sponge.

**ROBIN** _(to SINGERS)_: Shut up!\
_(to ARTHUR)_ No ... er ... no ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I certainly wasn't giving up ... I was actually looking for the grail ... er thing ... in this forest.

**ARTHUR**: No ... it lies beyond this forest.

**TALL KNIGHT**: Stop saying the word!

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: Stop saying the word! The word we cannot hear! The word ...

**ARTHUR** (losing his patience with the fearful KNIGHTS OF "NI"): Oh, stop it!

_Terrific confusion amongst the KNIGHTS OF "NI", they roll on the ground covering their ears. The TALL KNIGHT remains standing trying to control his MEN._

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: They're all saying the word ...

**TALL KNIGHT**: Stop saying it. AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: You've said it! Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... We're all saying it.

_ARTHUR beckons to BEDEVERE and ROBIN and they pick their way through the helpless KNIGHTS OF "NI" and away into the forest._
