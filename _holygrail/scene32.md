_MIX THROUGH TO the KNIGHTS entering the cave. It is a large cave and as they walk inside it we see in the darkness at the side of the cave a fearsome looking CREATURE which watches them with some surprise as they walk to some writing carved on the back of the cave wall. The KNIGHTS are accompanied by BROTHER MAYNARD._

**ARTHUR**: There! Look!

**BEDEVERE**: What does it say?

**GALAHAD**: What language is this?

**BEDEVERE**: Brother Maynard, you are a scholar.

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: It is Aramaic!

**GALAHAD**: Of course. Joseph of Aramathea!

**ALL**: Of course.

**ARTHUR**: What does it say?

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: It reads ... "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Aramathea."

_Excitement._

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: "He who is valorous and pure of heart may find the Holy Grail in the aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."

**ARTHUR**: What?

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: "The Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."

**BEDEVERE**: What's that?

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: He must have died while carving it.

**BEDEVERE**: Oh, come on.

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: That's what it says.

**ARTHUR** _(miming)_: But if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh". He'd just say it.

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: It's down there carved in stone.

**GALAHAD**: Perhaps he was dictating.

**ARTHUR**: Shut up. Is that all it says?

**BROTHER MAYNARD**: That's all. "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".

**ARTHUR**: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".

**BEDEVERE**: Do you think he meant the Camargue?

**GALAHAD**: Where's that?

**BEDEVERE**: France, I think.

**LAUNCELOT**: Isn't there a St. Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh's in Cornwall?

**ARTHUR**: No, that's Saint Ives.

_A muffled roar is heard._

<span>~~**ROBIN**: Hey!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE**: No, that's in Herefordshire.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ROBIN** _(more urgently)_: No ... HEY!!!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**LAUNCELOT**: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... "~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ROBIN**: No! "Hey"! is surprise and alarm!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>**BEDEVERE**: Oooooh!</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**LAUNCELOT**: No "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... " at the back of the throat.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**BEDEVERE**: No! "Oooooh!" in surprise and alarm!</span>{: .notice--success}

_He indicated the entrance of the cave. They all turn and look. There in the opening is a huge, unpleasant, fairly well drawn cartoon beast._

**ARTHUR**: Oh!

**GALAHAD**: My God!

**LAUNCELOT**: What is it?

**BEDEVERE**: I know! I know! I Know!

**ARTHUR**: What?

**BEDEVERE**: It's the ... oh ... _(snaps his fingers as he tries to remember)_ it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...

_Another hideous roar._

**BEDEVERE**: That's it!

**ARTHUR**: What?

**BEDEVERE**: It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

<span>~~_At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION. ARTHUR turns._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: Who was that?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**HECTOR** _(from back of group; northern and helpful)_: It was Sir Alf.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: I didn't know we had a Sir Alf.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**HECTOR**: He was feeding it bread.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR** _(shouting back)_: Well, that was a very silly thing to do. Now the rest of you stand well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**HECTOR**: Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ROBIN**: Look out.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them. The KNIGHTS retreat into the darkness of the cave._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**GAWAIN** _(as they run)_: It's only a cartoon.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: Sh!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

_They run off. Darkness. The MONSTER lumbering through on animation._

<span>**VOICE OVER**: As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when, suddenly ... the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**ANIMATOR**: Aaaaagh!</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**VOICE OVER**: The cartoon peril was no more ... The Quest for Holy Grail could continue.</span>{: .notice--success}

__ANIMATED SEQUENCE. Leads through to the group reappearing and seeing a distant opening to the cave. They reach the opening. It is day._
