_Quick sequence of SIR ROBIN. The music is jolly and bright, as if triumphant. ROBIN is not at all happy with the lyrics._

**SINGERS**: Brave Sir Robin ran away.

**ROBIN**: I didn't.

**SINGERS**: Bravely ran away, away.

**ROBIN**: No, no, no.

**SINGERS**: When danger reared its ugly head,\
He bravely turned his tail and fled\
Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about\
And gallantly he chickened out\
Bravely taking to his feet\
He beat a very brave retreat\
Bravest of the brave Sir Robin\
Petrified of being dead\
Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin\
Turned away and fled.

_They disappear into distance._

_**ANIMATION**: "The Tale Of Sir Galahad"_
