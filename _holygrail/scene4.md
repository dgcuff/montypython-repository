_MIX THROUGH to ARTHUR and PATSY riding through the forest. They pass rune stones. We TRACK with them. CLOSE-UPS of their faces as they ride. MIX to another TRACKING SHOT of them riding through the forest. They come to a clearing and stop, looking ahead intently. Their eyes light up._

_Sound FX of fight._

_CUT TO their eyeline. A clearing on the other side of which is a rough wooden foot-bridge across a stream. At the start of the bridge a tremendous fight is going on. A huge BLACK KNIGHT in black armor, his face totally masked in a visor, is fighting a slightly smaller KNIGHT in green armor. (Perhaps the GREEN KNIGHT's armor is identical to the BLACK KNIGHT's save for the color.)_

_CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY. They watch, growing more impressed as they watch the fight._

_CUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT lunges at the BLACK KNIGHT, who avoids the blow with a skillful side-step and parry, knocking the sword out of the GREEN KNIGHT's hand._

_CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY even more impressed._

_CUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT has drawn out a particularly nasty mace or spiked ball and chain, much longer than the BLACK KNIGHT's sword._

_ARTHUR narrows his eyes, wondering whether the BLACK KNIGHT will survive._

_CUT BACK to the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT swings at the BLACK KNIGHT, who ducks under the first swing, leaps over the second and starts to close on the GREEN KNIGHT._

_CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY watching like a tennis match. Sound FX of the fight reaching a climax. Four almighty clangs. Then Silence._

_CUT BACK to see the GREEN KNIGHT stretched out. The BLACK KNIGHT sheathes his sword._

_ARTHUR looks at PATSY. Nods and they move forward._

_CUT BACK TO the BLACK KNIGHT picking up the GREEN KNIGHT above his head and hurling him into the river. ARTHUR and PATSY approach him._

**ARTHUR**: You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.

<span>~~**BLACK KNIGHT**: Who dares to challenge the Black Knight?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: I do not challenge you.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

_The BLACK KNIGHT stares impassively and says nothing._

**ARTHUR**: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

_Hint of a pause as he waits for a reaction which doesn't come. ARTHUR is only slightly thrown._

**ARTHUR**: ... I seek the bravest and the finest knights in all the world to join me in my court at Camelot ...

_The BLACK KNIGHT remains silent_

**ARTHUR**: You have proved yourself worthy. ... Will you join me?

_Silence._

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: A man of your strength and skill would be the chief of all my knights ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BLACK KNIGHT**: Never.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

**ARTHUR**: You make me sad. But so be it. Come Patsy.

_As he moves, the BLACK KNIGHT bars the way._

**BLACK KNIGHT**: None shall pass.

**ARTHUR**: What?

**BLACK KNIGHT**: None shall pass.

**ARTHUR**: I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.

**BLACK KNIGHT**: Then you shall die.

**ARTHUR**: I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.

**BLACK KNIGHT**: I move for no man.

**ARTHUR**: So be it!

_ARTHUR draws his sword and approaches the BLACK KNIGHT. A furious fight now starts lasting about fifteen seconds at which point ARTHUR delivers a mighty blow which completely severs the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm at the shoulder. ARTHUR steps back triumphantly._

**ARTHUR**: Now stand aside worthy adversary.

**BLACK KNIGHT** _(Glancing at his shoulder)_: 'Tis but a scratch.

![Knight With Missing Arm](/images/knight1.jpg){: .align-right}

**ARTHUR**: A scratch? Your arm's off.

**BLACK KNIGHT**: No, it isn't.

**ARTHUR** _(Pointing to the arm on ground)_: Well, what's that then?

**BLACK KNIGHT**: I've had worse.

**ARTHUR**: You're a liar.

**BLACK KNIGHT**: Come on you pansy!

_Another ten seconds furious fighting till ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's other arm off, also at the shoulder. The arm plus sword, lies on the ground._

![Knight With Both Arms Missing](/images/knight2.jpg){: .align-right}

**ARTHUR**: Victory is mine.

**ARTHUR** _(sinking to his knees)_: I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...

**BLACK KNIGHT**: Come on then.

**ARTHUR**: What?

_He kicks ARTHUR hard on the side of the helmet. ARTHUR gets up still holding his sword. The BLACK KNIGHT comes after him kicking._

**ARTHUR**: You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.

**BLACK KNIGHT**: Had enough?

**ARTHUR**: You stupid bastard. You haven't got any arms left.

**BLACK KNIGHT**: Course I have.

**ARTHUR**: Look!

**BLACK KNIGHT**: What! Just a flesh wound. (kicks ARTHUR)

**ARTHUR**: Stop that.

**BLACK KNIGHT** _(kicking him)_: Had enough ... ?

**ARTHUR**: I'll have your leg.

_ARTHUR is kicked._

**ARTHUR**: Right!

_The BLACK KNIGHT kicks him again and ARTHUR chops his leg off. The BLACK KNIGHT keeps his balance with difficulty._

![Knight With Missing Leg](/images/knight3.jpg){: .align-right}

**BLACK KNIGHT**: I'll do you for that.

**ARTHUR**: You'll what ... ?

**BLACK KNIGHT**: Come Here.

**ARTHUR**: What are you going to do ... bleed on me?

**BLACK KNIGHT**: I'm invincible!

**ARTHUR**: You're a loony.

**BLACK KNIGHT**: The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!

_ARTHUR takes his last leg off. The BLACK KNIGHT's body lands upright._

![Knight At A Draw](/images/knight4.jpg){: .align-right}

**BLACK KNIGHT**: All right, we'll call it a draw.

**ARTHUR**: Come, Patsy.

_ARTHUR and PATSY start to cross the bridge._

**BLACK KNIGHT**: Running away eh? You yellow bastard, Come back here and take what's coming to you. I'll bite your legs off!
