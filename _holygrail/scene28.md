<span>**NOTE**: This entire scene was cut from the film.</span>{: .notice--warning}

_A Small group of PEASANTS are being shuffled into a group formation, at the apparent direction of someone behind the camera. A Few coughs as they shuffle together. a moment of silence. then they burst into pleasant (mellifluous) song._

Song: When the trees do blossom full and all the hills are green. Oh! Oh! We sing hey! hey! We sing our count....ry Song...

_A hail of arrow hits them and they crumple up. sound of raucous laughter OFF CAMERA._

_CUT TO Reveal a firing squad of ARCHERS kneeling not ten feet away from the group of SINGERS._

_Sitting on the throne on a dais is KING BRIAN THE WILD. He is roaring with, and his court is slightly shabby - bearing all the marks of a faded richness. it is a court without women, and nobody does the washing or shaves very well. Perhaps there is washing however on the line over the castle._

_KING BRIAN'S ADVISERS stand around him. Everyone bears the signs of past injuries (Except for BRIAN himself) I.E. they have an arm in a sling or head bandaged; all the people at court, except for BRIAN have their left arm missing (possibly the result of some violent edict a few years back)_

**KING BRIAN**: HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO! HA! HA! HA! HA! Oh! Very good! Next!

**FIRST ADVISER** _(a Little uncomfortably - perhaps his arm is in a sling obviously giving him some pain)_: There are no more, Sir.

**KING BRIAN** _(grabbing him by the collar)_: What do'you mean you filthy dog!

**FIRST ADVISER**: There are no more close harmony groups in the kingdom, Sir.

**KING BRIAN**: No more close harmony groups!!!

**FIRST ADVISER**: We have scoured the kingdom.

**KING BRIAN** _(lifting him bodily into the air and breaking his arm again slightly)_: You Miserable worm! you wretch! You Walking son of a dunghill keeper! Guards!

_Two Rather shabby looking GUARDS approach. (as everyone else they also have their left arms missing)_

**FIRST ADVISER**: have mercy your MAJESTY!

**KING BRIAN**: GUARDS! Take him away and suspend him by his nostrils from the highest tree in the kingdom!

_The Guards grab him unmercifully and drag him off. he whines piteously._
