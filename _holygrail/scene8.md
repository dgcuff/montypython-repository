_CUT TO interior of medieval hall. A large group of armored KNIGHTS are engaged in a well choreographed song-and-dance routine of the very up-beat 'If they could see me now' type of fast bouncy number. The poorer verses are made clearer by CUTTING to a group of knights actually engaged in the described task while the line itself is sung. They sing:_

**KNIGHTS**:

We're knights of the round table\
We dance whene'er we're able

![Knights at Camelot](https://old.mzonline.com/python/hgimages/camelot2.jpg){: .align-right}

We do routines and chorus scenes\
With footwork impeccable.\
We dine well here in Camelot\
We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.\
We're knights of the Round Table\
Our shows are formidable\
But many times\
We're given rhymes\
That are quite unsingable\
We're opera mad in Camelot\
We sing from the diaphragm a lot.

_Booming basses. A routine where two XYLOPHONISTS play parts of KNIGHTS' armor producing a pleasing effect._

In war we're tough and able.\
Quite indefatigable\
Between our quests\
We sequin vests\
And impersonate Clark Gable\
It's a busy life in Camelot.

**SINGLE MAN**: I have to push the pram a lot.

_CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and COMPANY as we had left them._

**ARTHUR**: No, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.

**KNIGHTS**: Right!

**ARTHUR**: It is a silly place.

_They set off again almost immediately they are suffused in ethereal radiance and strange heavenly choir music. The PAGES, horselike, take fright for a moment, they whinny and rattle their coconuts. ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS fall on their knees. A holy voice booms out._

**GOD**: Arthur! Arthur ... King of the Britons ...

_They all prostrate themselves even further._

**GOD**: Oh, don't grovel ... do get up! If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people groveling!!

_ARTHUR and COMPANY rise._

**ARTHUR**: Sorry ...

![God](https://old.mzonline.com/python/hgimages/blessing3.jpg){: .align-right}

**GOD**: And don't apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?

**ARTHUR**: I'm averting my eyes, Lord.

**GOD**: Well, don't.

<span>~~**GOD**: I really don't know where all this got started.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

**GOD**: It's like those miserable psalms. They're so depressing. Now knock it off.

**ARTHUR**: Yes, Lord.

**GOD**: Right. Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...

**ARTHUR**: Good idea, O Lord!

**GOD**: Course it's a good idea.

_Suddenly another light glows beside GOD or possibly within the light which is GOD a shape slowly starts to form._

**GOD**: Behold ... Arthur ... this is the Holy Grail ...

<span>~~**GOD**: ... the Sacred Cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

_The form in the bright light is just discernible as an iridescent chalice ... the KNIGHTS gasp._

**GOD**: Look well, Arthur ... for it is your sacred task to seek this Grail. It begins to fade. Music crescendo as both lights fade. That is your purpose Arthur ... the Quest for the Holy Grail ...

_It is gone. All the KNIGHTS are left gasping in awe and wonderment. They all turn and look at ARTHUR._

**LAUNCELOT**: A Blessing. A blessing from the lord.

<span>~~**BEDEVERE**: Praise be to God!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_An awed pause, then ARTHUR rallies them._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: We have a task, we must waste no time! To Camelot!~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>**GALAHAD**: God be praised!</span>{: .notice--success}

_Stirring music crescendo. They ride off._
