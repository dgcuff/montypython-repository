_Suddenly they appear at water's edge. They look across the water. A huge expanse disappearing into the mist. How can they cross?_

_Suddenly the air is filled with ethereal music, and out of the mist appears a wonderful barge silently and slowly drifting towards them._

<span>~~_They gaze in wonder. The mysterious boat comes to where they are standing. As if bewitched, they find themselves drawing closer to the boat. As they are about to step in, a ragged figure looks up at them._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BOATKEEPER** _(he is the same as the BRIDGEKEEPER and the SOOTHSAYER)_: He who would cross the Sea of Fate must answer me these questions twenty-eight.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_He fixes them with a baleful eye, ARTHUR and BEDEVERE exchange glances, then turn, with minds made up, pick him up bodily and throw him in the water._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_They climb into the boat and the boat moves off into the mist_~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_FADE OUT_~~</span>{: .notice--warning}
