_A young, quite embarrassingly unattractive PRINCE is gazing out of a castle window. His FATHER stands beside him. He is also looking out. The PRINCE wears a long white undershirt (like a night shirt)._

**FATHER**: One day, lad, all this will be yours ...

**PRINCE**: What - the curtains?

**FATHER**: No! Not the curtains, lad ... All that ...

_(indicates the vista from the window)_

**FATHER**: ... all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.

**PRINCE**: But, Mother ...

**FATHER**: Father, lad.

**PRINCE**: But, Father, I don't really want any of that.

**FATHER**: Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing. All I had when I started was swamp ... other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp. I built another one ... That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp .... So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.

**PRINCE**: But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...

**FATHER**: Rather what?

**PRINCE**: I'd rather ... just ... sing ...

_MUSIC INTRO_

**FATHER**: You're not going to do a song while I'm here!

_Music stops._

**FATHER**: Listen, lad, in twenty minutes you're going to be married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.

**PRINCE**: I don't want land.

**FATHER**: Listen, Alice ...

**PRINCE**: Herbert.

**FATHER**: Herbert ... We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.

**PRINCE**: But I don't like her.

**FATHER**: Don't like her? What's wrong with her? She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge ... tracts of land ...

**PRINCE**: I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to have ... a certain ... special ... something ...

_MUSIC INTO FOR song._

**FATHER**: Cut that out!

_Music cuts off abruptly._

**FATHER**: You're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea! Guards!

_TWO GUARDS enter and stand to attention on either side of the door. One of them has hiccoughs and does so throughout._

**FATHER**: Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.

**FIRST GUARD**: Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.

**FATHER**: No. Until I come and get him.

**SECOND GUARD**: Hic.

**FIRST GUARD**: Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.

**FATHER**: No ... You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.

**FIRST GUARD**: ... and you'll come and get him.

**SECOND GUARD**: Hic.

**FATHER**: That's Right.

**FIRST GUARD**: We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.

**FATHER**: Leaving the room.

**FIRST GUARD**: Leaving the room ... yes.

**FATHER**: Got it?

**SECOND GUARD**: Hic.

_FATHER makes to leave._

**FIRST GUARD**: Er ... if ... we ... er ...

**FATHER**: Yes?

**FIRST GUARD**: If we ... er ...

_(trying to remember what he was going to say)_

**FATHER**: Look, it's simple. Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.

**SECOND GUARD**: Hic.

**FATHER**: Right?

**FIRST GUARD**: Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?

**FATHER** _(carefully)_: No .... keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...

**FIRST GUARD**: Oh, yes! we'll keep him in here, obviously. But if he had to leave and we were with him.

**FATHER**: No ... just keep him in here.

**FIRST GUARD**: Until you, or anyone else ...

**FATHER**: No, not anyone else - just me.

**FIRST GUARD**: Just you ...

**SECOND GUARD**: Hic.

**FIRST GUARD**: Get back.

**FATHER**: Right.

**FIRST GUARD**: Okay. Fine. We'll remain here until you get back.

**FATHER**: And make sure he doesn't leave.

**FIRST GUARD**: What?

**FATHER**: Make sure he doesn't leave.

**FIRST GUARD**: The Prince ... ?

**FATHER**: Yes ... make sure ...

**FIRST GUARD**: Oh yes, of course! I thought you meant him!

_(he points to the other GUARD and laughs to himself)_

**FIRST GUARD**: You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...

**FATHER**: Is that clear?

**SECOND GUARD**: Hic.

**FIRST GUARD**: Oh, yes. That's quite clear. No problems.

_FATHER pulls open the door and makes to leave the room. The GUARDS follow._

**FATHER** _(to the GUARDS)_: Where are you going?

**FIRST GUARD**: We're coming with you.

**FATHER**: No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.

**FIRST GUARD**: Oh, I see, Right.

_They take up positions on either side of the door._

**PRINCE**: But, Father.

**FATHER**: Shut your noise, you, and get that suit on!

_He points to a wedding suit on a table or chair. FATHER throws one last look at the BOY and turns, goes out and slams the door._

_The PRINCE slumps onto window seat, looking forlornly out of the window. MUSIC INTRO to song ..._

_The door flies open, the music cuts off and FATHER pokes his head in._

**FATHER**: And no singing!

**SECOND GUARD**: Hic.

**FATHER** _(as he goes out)_: Go and have a drink of water.

_FATHER slams the door again. The GUARDS take up their positions. The SON gazes out of the window again ... sighs ... thinks ... a thought strikes him ... he gets up, crosses to his desk and scribbles a quick note and impales it on an arrow ... takes a bow down from the wall ... and fires the arrow out of the window._

_He looks wetly defiant at the GUARDS, who smile pleasantly._
