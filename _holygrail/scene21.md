_CUT TO inside of the castle grounds or courtyard._

_In the sunlight beautifully dressed WEDDING GUESTS are arriving. Converging on a doorway. A country dance in progress._

_SIR LAUNCELOT rushes towards them._

_CUT TO HAND-HELD CLOSE-UPS as he charges through the crowd, hacking right and left a la Errol Flynn at all who come in his way._

_He fights his way through the country dance. Blood. Shrieks. Bemused looks of GUESTS - not horror so much as uncomprehending surprise._

_Possibly Errol Flynn music._

_One COUNTRY DANCER is left holding just a hand._

_Right and left the GUESTS crumple in pools of blood as he fights his way through the door and into the main hall._
