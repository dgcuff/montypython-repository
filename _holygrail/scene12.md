_They now pass three KNIGHTS impaled to a tree. With their feet off the ground, with one lance through the lot of them, they are skewered up like a barbecue._

_Then they pass three KNIGHTS sitting on the ground with one enormous axe through their skulls. They look timorous._

<span>~~_Then a huge tree is absolutely packed with MAIDENS tied to it. They all look fed up. SIR ROBIN calls out cheerfully as he passes._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ROBIN**: Morning.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ONE LADY**: Bye.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

_SIR ROBIN rides on a little way with the music building up enormous and terrifying tension, until suddenly there standing before him is an enormous THREE-HEADED KNIGHT._

**THREE HEADS**: Halt! Who art thou?

**SINGERS**: He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...

**ROBIN** _(to SINGERS)_: Shut up. Oh, nobody really. just passing through.

**THREE HEADS**: What do you want?

**SINGERS**: To fight and ...

**ROBIN**: Shut up. Nothing really. Just to pass through, good Sir knight.

**THREE HEADS**: I'm afraid not.

<span>~~**THREE HEADS**: This is my bit of the forest. Find your own bit.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

**ROBIN**: I am a Knight of King Arthur's Round Table.

<span>~~**ROBIN**: I seek the Holy Grail - Stand aside and let me pass.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

**THREE HEADS**: You are a Knight of the Round Table?

**ROBIN**: I am.

_From now on the THREE HEADS speak individually._

**SECOND HEAD**: Shit.

**FIRST HEAD**: In that case I shall have to kill you.

**SECOND HEAD**: Shall I?

**THIRD HEAD**: Oh, I don't think so.

**SECOND HEAD**: I'm not sure.

**MIDDLE HEAD** _(to FIRST)_: What do I think?

**LEFT HEAD**: I think kill him.

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: I'm still not sure.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: All right. How many of me think I should kill him?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: I do.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: One.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: That's not a quorum.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: It is if I'm the Chairman.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: Oo, it's not.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: I'm the Chairman this week.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: You're not.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: Look, it'll make it much simpler if I vote with me.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: To kill him.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: Yeah.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD** _(tuts)_: Oh, damn.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD** _(to SIR ROBIN)_: Knight, I have decided to kill you.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: With one absenting.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: Knight, I have decided to kill you with one absenting.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD** _(to SIR ROBIN)_: Sorry about this but I have to be fair.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ROBIN**: Oh, that's all right. So you are going to kill me with your big axe.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: Er no, with my sword.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: Dagger.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: Mace is quicker.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: No, no, the sword, it's easier.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: He said axe.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ROBIN**: Look, hurry up six eyes, or I shall cut your head off.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD** _(to SIR ROBIN, referring to FIRST HEAD)_: For God's sake, CUT that one off, and do us all a favor.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: What do you mean?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: Yapping on all the time.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: You're lucky, you're not next to him.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: What do you mean?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: You snore.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: Oo, lies. Anyway, you've got bad breath.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD** _(aspirating heavily)_: I haven't.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_Both THIRD and FIRST HEADS turn away slightly, making faces._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: It's not my fault. It's what you both eat.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: Look, stop this bitching. We've got a knight to kill.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: He's buggered off.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: So he has. He's scampered.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: That's all your fault.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: No, it's not.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD** _(swipes at himself)_: Take that.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SECOND HEAD**: Ow.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**FIRST HEAD**: I'm sorry.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**THIRD HEAD**: 'Ere, stop it. I'll teach you.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_The BODY starts laying into itself with sword and mace, while the HEADS argue and shout with pain. We PAN gently across to the MAIDENS on their tree. They are still very fed up._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**MAIDEN**: I suppose we're lucky he's only got three heads.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**LOVELY**: Chance would be a fine thing.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>**THIRD HEAD**: Oh! let's be nice to him.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**FIRST HEAD**: Oh shut up.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**SECOND HEAD**: Yes - do us all a favor.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**FIRST HEAD**: What?</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**THIRD HEAD**: Yapping on all the time.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**SECOND HEAD**: You're lucky, you're not next to him.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**THIRD HEAD**: What do you mean?</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**THIRD HEAD**: Ooh, lies! anyway you've got bad breath.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**SECOND HEAD**: Well only because you don't brush my teeth ...</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**THIRD HEAD**: Oh! stop bickering and let's go and have tea and biscuits.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**FIRST HEAD**: All right! All right! We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**SECOND HEAD**: Yes.</span>{: .notice--success}
