_CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT who is only just arriving on the other side. He looks back across the invisible chasm. Dimly in the distance he hears:_

**GAWAIN** _(OUT OF VISION)_: Sir Gawain of Camelot!

**BRIDGEKEEPER** _(OOV)_: What is your quest?

**GAWAIN** _(OOV)_: To seek the Holy Grail.

**BRIDGEKEEPER** _(OOV)_: What goes: black white ... black white ... black white?

**GAWAIN** _(OOV)_: Oh, er ... Babylon! er ... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!

_SIR LAUNCELOT stands on the other side of the bridge. In the distance we hear the ritual of questions and then a scream and thud, suddenly a hand lands on LAUNCELOT's shoulder._

**POLICEMAN** _(VOICE OVER)_: Just want to ask you some questions, sir.

_LAUNCELOT turns and reacts. He is led away._
