_A village. Sound of chanting of Latin canon, punctuated by short, sharp cracks. It comes nearer. We see it is a line of MONKS ala SEVENTH SEAL flagellation scene, chanting and banging themselves on the foreheads with wooden boards. They pass a group of villagers who are dragging a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN dressed as a witch through the streets. They drag her to a strange house/ruin standing on a hill outside the village. A strange-looking knight stands outside, SIR BEDEVERE._

**FIRST VILLAGER**: We have found a witch. May we burn her?

**ALL**: A Witch! Burn her!

**BEDEVERE**: How do you know she is a witch?

**ALL**: She looks like one. Yes, she does.

**BEDEVERE**: Bring her forward.

_They bring her forward - a beautiful YOUNG GIRL (MISS ISLINGTON) dressed up as a witch._

**WITCH**: I am not a witch. I am not a witch.

**BEDEVERE**: But you are dressed as one.

**WITCH**: They dressed me up like this.

**ALL**: We didn't, we didn't!

**WITCH**: This is not my nose, It is a false one.

_BEDEVERE takes her nose off._

**BEDEVERE**: Well?

**FIRST VILLAGER**: ... Well, we did do the nose.

**BEDEVERE**: The nose?

**FIRST VILLAGER**: And the hat. But she is a witch.

**ALL**: A witch, a witch, burn her!

**BEDEVERE**: Did you dress her up like this?

**FIRST VILLAGER**: ... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.

**BEDEVERE**: Why do you think she is a witch?

**SECOND VILLAGER**: She turned me into a newt.

**BEDEVERE**: A newt?

**SECOND VILLAGER** _(After looking at himself for some time)_: I got better.

**ALL**: Burn her anyway.

**BEDEVERE**: Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.

_ARTHUR and PATSY ride up at this point and watch what follows with interest._

**ALL**: There are? Tell up. What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?

**BEDEVERE**: Tell me ... what do you do with witches?

**ALL**: Burn them.

**BEDEVERE**: And what do you burn, apart from witches?

**FOURTH VILLAGER**: ... Wood?

**BEDEVERE**: So why do witches burn?

**SECOND VILLAGER** _(pianissimo)_: ... Because they're made of wood...?

**BEDEVERE**: Good.

_PEASANTS stir uneasily then come round to this conclusion._

**ALL**: I see. Yes, of course.

**BEDEVERE**: So how can we tell if she is made of wood?

**FIRST VILLAGER**: Make a bridge out of her.

![Villagers](https://old.mzonline.com/python/hgimages/witch1.jpg){: .align-right}

**BEDEVERE**: Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?

**ALL**: Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ...

**BEDEVERE**: Does wood sink in water?

**ALL**: No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond. Tie weights on her. To the pond.

**BEDEVERE**: Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?

**ALL**: Bread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...

**ARTHUR**: A duck.

_They all turn and look at ARTHUR. BEDEVERE looks up very impressed._

**BEDEVERE**: Exactly. So... logically ...

**FIRST VILLAGER** _(beginning to pick up the thread)_: If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.

**BEDEVERE**: And therefore?

**ALL**: A witch! ... A duck! A duck! Fetch a duck.

**FOURTH VILLAGER**: Here is a duck, Sir Bedevere.

**BEDEVERE**: We shall use my largest scales.

_He leads them a few yards to a very strange contraption indeed, made of wood and rope and leather. They put the GIRL in one pan and the duck in another. Each pan is supported by a wooden stave. BEDEVERE checks each pan then ... ARTHUR looks on with interest._

**BEDEVERE**: Remove the supports.

_Two PEASANTS knock them away with sledge hammers. The GIRL and the duck swing slightly but balance perfectly._

**ALL**: A witch! A witch!

**WITCH**: It's a fair cop.

**ALL**: Burn her! Burn her! Let's make her into a ladder.

_The VILLAGERS drag the girl away, leaving ARTHUR and BEDEVERE regarding each other admiringly._

**BEDEVERE**: Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?

**ARTHUR**: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

**BEDEVERE**: My liege ... forgive me ...

_ARTHUR looks at PATSY with obvious satisfaction._

**ARTHUR**: Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?

**BEDEVERE**: My liege, I am honored.

_ARTHUR steps forward, drawing his sword, with a slight hint of difficulty._

**ARTHUR**: What is your name?

**BEDEVERE**: Bedevere, my Liege.

**ARTHUR**: Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
