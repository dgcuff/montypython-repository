Dear Mike,

The Censor's representative, Tony Kerpel, came along to Friday's screening at Twinkenham and he gave up his opinion of the film's probable certificate.

He thinks the film will be AA, but it would be possible, given some dialogue cuts, to make the film an A rating, which would increase the audience. (AA is 14 and over, and A is 5-14).

For an 'A' we would have to:

Lose as may shits as possible

Take Jesus Christ out, if possible

Lose "I fart in your general direction" Lose "the oral sex"

Lose "oh, fuck off"

Lose "We make castanets out of your testicles"

I would like to get back to the Censor and agree to lose the shits, take the odd Jesus Christ out and lose Oh fuck off, but to retain 'fart in your general direction', 'castanets of your testicles' and 'oral sex' and ask him for an 'A' rating on that basis.

Please let me know as soon as possible your attitude to this.

Yours sincerely,

Mark Forstater
