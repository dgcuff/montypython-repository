_CUT BACK to the glade where the KNIGHTS OF NI! were. A police car roars up. Two PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE and a CONSTABLE get out, look around suspiciously, perhaps kneel and examine the ground. one POLICEMAN finds PATSY's shoe and the other finds a strange scientific instrument that was hanging from BEDEVERE. They nod grimly to each other. Climb back in the car and drive off._
