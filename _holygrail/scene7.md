_Fairly close HEAD-ON SHOT of the KNIGHTS riding along. BEDEVERE and ARTHUR at the front of the group deep in conversation._

**BEDEVERE**: And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.

**ARTHUR**: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

**BEDEVERE**: OF course, my Liege ...

**LAUNCELOT** _(he points)_: Look, my liege!

_They all stop and look._

**ARTHUR** _(with thankful reverence)_: Camelot!

_CUT TO shot of amazing castle in the distance. Illuminated in the rays of the setting sun._

_Music._

_CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and the group. They are all staring with fascination._

**GALAHAD**: Camelot ...

**LAUNCELOT**: Camelot ...

**GAWAIN** _(at the back, to PAGE)_: It's only a model.

**ARTHUR** _(turning sharply)_: Sh!\
_(to the rest)_: Knights! I bid you welcome to your new home! Let us ride ... to Camelot.
