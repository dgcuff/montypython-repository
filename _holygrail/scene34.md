_CUT TO them struggling along. Perhaps downhill now. It is growing misty._

_SIR LAUNCELOT stops them and points. They peer._

_CUT TO see in the mist ... a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the gorge below. We cannot see the other side._

_Beside the bridge an OLD MAN stands, he is the blind soothsayer they met earlier in the forest._

<span>~~**ARTHUR** _(to BEDEVERE)_: He's the Keeper of the Bridge. It's the old man.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**BEDEVERE** _(swallowing hard)_: Who's going to answer the questions?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_ARTHUR restrains him._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**LAUNCELOT**: Yes, my liege ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot! Be careful ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~_They shake hands, Arthur's eyes moisten. LAUNCELOT approaches the Bridge of Death._~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>**GALAHAD**: Three questions.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>**ARTHUR**: Three questions, may cross in safety.</span>{: .notice--success}

<span>_LAUNCELOT APPROACHES THE BRIDGEKEEPER._</span>{: .notice--success}

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: Stop!

_SIR LAUNCELOT stops. The KNIGHTS watch anxiously. ARTHUR sniffs briefly and glances momentarily down at SIR ROBIN's lower armor._

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: Who approaches the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three! Ere the other side he see.

**LAUNCELOT**: Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: What is your name

**LAUNCELOT**: My name is Sir Launcelot.

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: What is your quest?

**LAUNCELOT**: To find the Holy Grail.

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: What is your favorite color?

**LAUNCELOT**: Blue.

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: Right. Off you go.

_SIR LAUNCELOT runs across into the mist. The bridge perhaps disappears into the mist and we cannot see the other side. ARTHUR and SIR ROBIN exchange glances. ROBIN breathes a great sigh of relief._

**ROBIN**: That's easy!

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three! Ere the other side he see!

**ROBIN**: Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: What is your name?

**ROBIN**: My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: What is your quest?

**ROBIN**: To seek the Grail!

**BRIDGEKEEPER**: What is the capital of Assyria?

**ROBIN** _(indignantly)_: I don't know that!

_He is immediately hurled by some unseen force over the edge of the precipice._

**ROBIN**: Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
