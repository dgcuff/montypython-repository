_We CUT TO an almost subliminal shot of the HISTORIAN'S WIFE being shown into a police car, which then roars off out of the glade._

_CUT BACK to the forest. The Knights of "NI" are slowly recovering. they get up._

**TALL KNIGHT**: Well, At least We've got ONE shrubbery.

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: Yes, Yes ... We've Done very Well ... NI!

**TALL KNIGHT**: Ssh! I think somebody's coming. We'll get them to give us another shrubbery.

**OTHER KNIGHTS**: Good Idea. More shrubberies. As many as possible.

_Perhaps we start to TRACK BACK from the scene as they go on talking._

**TALL KNIGHT**: What shall we call ourselves this time?

**KNIGHT**: How about "The knights of Nicky-Nicky"?
