_Two hanging banners one each side of the gate with the monogram: "H & L"._

_TWO SENTRIES with spears ... slightly weddingly ... red ribbons on their right spears. We can hear from inside revelry and celebration music._

_We hear LAUNCELOT's footsteps. The TWO SENTRIES are watching him. One of them raises his hand._

<span>~~**FIRST SENTRY**: Halt, friend ...~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

_LAUNCELOT leaps into SHOT with a mighty cry and runs the GUARD through and hacks him to the floor. Blood. Swashbuckling music (perhaps). LAUNCELOT races through into the castle screaming._

**SECOND SENTRY**: Hey!

_He looks down at his mutilated comrade._
