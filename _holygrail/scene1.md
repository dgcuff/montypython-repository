_Mist. Several seconds of it swirling about. silence possibly, atmospheric music. SUPERIMPOSE "England AD 787". After a few more seconds we hear hoofbeats in the distance. They come slowly closer. Then out of the mist comes KING ARTHUR followed by a SERVANT who is banging two half coconuts together. ARTHUR raises his hand._

**ARTHUR**: Whoa there!

_SERVANT makes noises of horses halting, with a flourish. ARTHUR peers through the mist. CUT TO shot from over his shoulder: castle (e.g. Bodium) rising out of the mist. On the castle battlements a SOLDIER is dimly seen. He peers down._

**SOLDIER**: Halt! Who goes there?

**ARTHUR**: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of all Britons, defeater of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!

_Pause._

**SOLDIER**: Pull the other one!

**ARTHUR**: I am... And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and master.

**SOLDIER**: What? Ridden on a horse?

**ARTHUR**: Yes!

**SOLDIER**: You're using coconuts!

**ARTHUR**: ...What?

**SOLDIER**: You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.

**ARTHUR** _(Scornfully)_: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.

**SOLDIER**: Where did you get the coconuts?

**ARTHUR**: Through ... We found them.

**SOLDIER**: Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical!

**ARTHUR**: What do you mean?

**SOLDIER**: Well, this is a temperate zone.

**ARTHUR**: The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

**SOLDIER**: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?

**ARTHUR**: Not at all. They could be carried.

**SOLDIER**: What? A swallow carrying a coconut?

<span>~~**ARTHUR**: Why not?~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

<span>~~**SOLDIER**: I'll tell you why not ... because a swallow is about eight inches long and weighs five ounces, and you'd be lucky to find a coconut under a pound.~~</span>{: .notice--warning}

**ARTHUR**: It could grip it by the husk ...

**SOLDIER**: It's not a question of where he grips it, It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ... A five-ounce bird could not hold a one pound coconut.

**ARTHUR**: Well, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

_A Slight pause. Swirling mist. Silence._

**SOLDIER**: Look! To maintain air speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second. right?

**ARTHUR** _(irritated)_: Please!

**SOLDIER**: Am I right?

**ARTHUR**: I'm not interested.

**SECOND SOLDIER** _(who has loomed up on the battlements)_: It could be carried by an African swallow!

**FIRST SOLDIER**: Oh yes! An African swallow maybe ... but not a European swallow. That's my point.

**SECOND SOLDIER**: Oh yes, I agree there ...

**ARTHUR** _(losing patience)_: Will you ask your master if he wants to join the Knights of Camelot?!

**FIRST SOLDIER**: But then of course African swallows are non-migratory.

**SECOND SOLDIER**: Oh yes.

_ARTHUR raises his eyes heavenwards and nods to PATSY. They turn and go off into the mist._

**FIRST SOLDIER**: So they wouldn't be able to bring a coconut back anyway.

**SECOND SOLDIER**: Wait a minute! Suppose two swallows carried it together?

**FIRST SOLDIER**: No, they'd have to have it on a line.

_Stillness. Silence again._
