_CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT running up spiral staircase. He reaches the door of the PRINCE's room. he flings it open._

**FIRST GUARD**: Ah! Now ... we're not allowed to ...

_SIR LAUNCELOT runs him through, grabs his spear and stabs the other guard who collapses in a heap. Hiccoughs quietly._

_SIR LAUNCELOT runs to the window and kneels down in front of the PRINCE, averting his head._

**LAUNCELOT**: Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot. I have come to take you ... (he looks up for the first time and his voice trails away) away ... I'm terribly sorry ...

**PRINCE**: You got my note!

**LAUNCELOT**: Well ... yes ...

**PRINCE**: You've come to rescue me?

**LAUNCELOT**: Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realized ...

**PRINCE** _(his eyes light up)_: I knew that someone would come. I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...

_MUSIC INTRO to song._

**FATHER** _(suddenly looking in the door)_: Stop that!

_Music cuts out._

_FATHER sees SIR LAUNCELOT still kneeling before his son._

**FATHER**: Who are you?

**PRINCE**: I'm ... your son ...

**FATHER**: Not you.

**LAUNCELOT** _(half standing self-consciously)_: I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.

**PRINCE**: He's come to rescue me, father.

**LAUNCELOT** _(embarrassed)_: Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...

**FATHER**: Did you kill all those guards?

**LAUNCELOT**: Yes ... I'm very sorry ...

**FATHER**: They cost fifty pounds each!

**LAUNCELOT**: Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...

**PRINCE**: Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot. I've got a rope here all ready ...

_He throws a rope out of the window which is tied to a pillar in the room. He looks rather pleased with himself that he has got it all ready._

**FATHER**: You killed eight wedding guests in all!

**LAUNCELOT**: Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.

**FATHER**: I can understand that.

**PRINCE** _(half out of the window)_: Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!

**FATHER** _(to his SON)_: Shut up!

**FATHER** _(to LAUNCELOT)_: You only killed the bride's father - that's all -

**LAUNCELOT**: Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...

**FATHER**: Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!

**LAUNCELOT**: Gosh - Is he all right?

**FATHER**: You even kicked the bride in the chest! It's going to cost me a fortune!

**LAUNCELOT**: I can explain ... I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.

**FATHER**: Camelot? Are you from Camelot?

_The PRINCE's head peeps over the windowsill._

**PRINCE**: Hurry!

**LAUNCELOT**: I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.

**FATHER**: 'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....

**LAUNCELOT**: Is it?

**PRINCE** _(out of vision)_: I am ready, Sir Launcelot.

**FATHER**: Do you want to come and have a drink?

**LAUNCELOT**: Oh ... that's awfully nice.

**PRINCE** _(out of view)_ _(loud and shrill)_: I am ready!

_As they walk past the rope, the FATHER nonchalantly cuts with his knife. There is no sound except after a pause a slight squeal from very far away as the PRINCE makes contact with the ground._

**LAUNCELOT**: It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...

**FATHER**: Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?

_He puts his arm round LAUNCELOT's shoulders as they go though the door._
