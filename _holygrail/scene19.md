_CUT TO the middle of the forest. SIR LAUNCELOT is riding along with a trusty servant, CONCORDE._

**LAUNCELOT**: And ... o v e r ... we go!

_He strides over a big tree trunk ... his "horse" does run and jump ..._

**LAUNCELOT** _(enthusiastically)_: Well taken, Concorde!

**CONCORDE**: Thank you, sir, most kind ...

**LAUNCELOT**: And another!

_CONCORDE misses a beat._

**LAUNCELOT**: Steady! Good ... and the last one ...

_CONCORDE does the run-up with the coconuts. He does the break for the leap ... there is a thwack. SIR LAUNCELOT is waiting for the horse to land._

**CONCORDE**: Message for you, sir.

_He falls forward revealing the arrow with the note._

**LAUNCELOT**: Concorde - speak to me.

_He realizes he might be in danger and so starts to crawl off ... when he notices the note. He takes it out and reads it._

**LAUNCELOT** _(reading)_: "To whoever finds this note - I have been imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry against my will. Please please please please come and rescue me. I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."

_SIR LAUNCELOT's eyes light up with holy inspiration._

**LAUNCELOT**: At last! A call! A cry of distress ...

_He draws his sword, and turns to CONCORDE._

**LAUNCELOT**: Concorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!

**CONCORDE**: I'm not quite dead, sir ...

**LAUNCELOT** _(a little deflated)_: Oh, well ... er brave Concorde! You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!

**CONCORDE**: I think I could pull through, sir.

**LAUNCELOT**: Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.

_He makes to leap off dramatically._

**CONCORDE**: I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.

**LAUNCELOT**: I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.

**CONCORDE**: Really, I feel fine, sir.

**LAUNCELOT**: Farewell, Concorde!

**CONCORDE**: It just seems silly ... me lying here.

_SIR LAUNCELOT plunges off into the forest._
